We recommend this experience to any faculty or staff who want to explore online learning communities and how this can lead to unique learning opportunities for students. #DigPINS is designed to welcome anyone that has an interest in teaching and learning, whether you consider yourself comfortable teaching in online spaces or if you are just getting started.\n#DigPINS is a place to:\nConsider how your identity, as a teacher and a scholar, is perceived in a digital context\nThink about and question digital influences on education\nPractice navigating (both socially and technically) different digital environments – both open and more private\nFind overlaps and intersections of these digital topics with colleagues from our network schools. Check out the\nDiscuss Hub\nto see schools that have participated along us in the past. This year our cohort will be running alongside cohorts from Kenyon College, Unversity of Michigan-Dearbon, and The American University in Cairo.\nWhen is it?\nJune 1st through June 6th\nWeek 0\n– This week allows us to get comfortable with the tools we will be using, no readings or activities happen during this week\nJune 7th through June 13th\nWeek 1 – Modality\nJune 14th through June 20th\nWeek 2 – Equity, Inclusion, and Agency\nJune 21st through June 27th\nWeek 3 – Assessment\nJune 28 through July 2nd\nWeek 4 – Participant Choice\n! – We’ll talk more about this during Week 1!\nWhat does participating in #DigPINS look like?\nParticipation in #DigPINS is based around discussion. Each week there are a couple readings and activities that you check out at your own pace, then you bring your thoughts on the week’s content back to the larger group discussion. We communicate with our cohort and with peers from other schools via blog posts, online chat, and Twitter. All together, you should expect to spend 2 – 4 hours per week exploring content and participating in discussion. We would also encourage you to check out the\nblog posts on our #DigPINS website\nto get a better idea of what #DigPINS is about!"}

We form one network as a group doing #DigPINS together; there is a larger network of all those who have taken #DigPINS in the past at SNC and elsewhere, and in interacting with our colleagues in other cohorts, we will branch that network out even further.\nSome of our guiding questions this week include:\nWho do you interact with online?\nHow do you find and join networks?\nWhat are your current networks?\nWhat are the affordances and limitations of particular networks?\nWhat role do you play (or might you want to play) in these networks?\nPersonal Learning Network (PLN)\nAs we begin to talk about digital networks, we start to talk about being more resident in more public places.

Then check out who they follow, the hashtags they use, etc. Connect with ones that you feel an affinity towards. (Or, going back to our Identity week, think about spaces where you’re already connecting with your professional communities, and how you might engage in those networks differently.)\nOur examples this week will focus on Twitter, but if you discover useful groups on other platforms (like Slack or Discord or Facebook or good old blogs and email!), think about how they fit into your developing digital identity.\nCheck out the list of suggested twitter accounts\n(and hashtags) from the #DigPINS facilitators – follow accounts that look interesting to you.\nTweet using #DigPINS –\nWe do want to continue having conversations in Slack and on the blog, but this week you should start working in the public more.\n(Disclaimer: if you have concerns about working in the public due to security or privacy talk to me).\nMaybe consider not just promoting your blog post in Slack but posting it to Twitter – don’t forget to tag #DigPINS. Our main prompt for the week is to consider people and environments for building your PLN and share your process for finding and connecting with them. And of course, people who have participated in\n#DigPINS\nin the past might be good folks to connect to! You can identify past participants by searching for\n#DigPINS\non Twitter and scrolling through the search results.\nJoin our Digital Scavenger Hunt!\nEvery day this week, one of the facilitators will post a scavenger hunt goal for the day. Your mission will be to:\nShare\nwhat you find for each day’s prompt.\nCheck\nthe #DigPINS hashtag to see what other people are finding, and respond to someone each day.\nOver the course of the week,\nquote\nsomeone’s response, adding a comment or question.\nOver the course of the week, send a\nprivate message\nto one of the facilitators, and we will reply. Twitter doesn’t only have to be in the public timeline, the Direct Message (or DM) feature works more like texting an individual or small group.\nCheck your Twitter “notifications”\nto see what conversations you have been mentioned or tagged in. Respond to any notifications that you feel compelled to, and consider retweeting tweets you think are pertinent.  Add your ideas via tweet to the growing conversation.\nAlways remember to add the #DigPINS hashtag.\nWe’ve imagined this as primarily an activity to get you used to Twitter, but if you’re not ready for that yet, or if any given prompt feels like something you’d prefer to keep privateyc, you can respond in Slack instead of on Twitter.“\nPlay\n” the Nicky Case narrative game\nThe Wisdom and/or Madness of Crowds\nto dip your toe into the world of network science. We use this “explainer” to start conversations about information literacy in networks; it should prompt some thoughts about how you want to tune your networks to bring in the kinds of information you want and need, and be resilient against “fake news.” You may also think about what kind of role you play (or might want to play) in your networks (e.g. fostering bonding and/or bridging ties between your networks). (There are lots of neat extra resources linked in this game; feel free not to follow every footnote. Unless you want to!)\nOptional: if you enjoy this, Case has recently released an explainer on\nfuture COVID-19 scenarios\n. This is not related to DigPINS at all, but it might be interesting to you for its topic, or as an example of good science writing.\nRead\nCritical Digital Citizenship: Promoting Empathy and Social Justice Online\nby Maha Bali\nHatching a PLN\nby Terry Greene\nPersonal Learning Networks: Knowledge Sharing as Democracy\n– Alison Seaman\nDigital Identity in a World that Never Forgets\n– Alec Couros and Katia Hildebrandt\nTechnical Help\nGetting Started w/ Twitter\nTweetDeck\n– Twitter can be overwhelming because of so much information coming at you at once. TweetDeck is a tool that allows you to organize by search terms, hashtags, user lists… etc. You might be interested in trying out TweetDeck if you are looking for a way to organize Twitter for yourself.\nVideo of How to Use Tweetdeck\nAnd of course remember you can reach out to us if you need help by direct messages on Twitter, or through Slack or email."}

But you have to cobble that self together from the nearly infinite contexts and selves reflected back at you by the disco ball of the blank screen.\nThat image of the blank screen as a reflecting disco ball is intelligent and thought-provoking, and moves towards being a moment of poetry.  So one question I hope the next several weeks will help answer is this: “Is there something about a digital presence that can release a person’s imagination in a special or distinctive way?”\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nMoral Transformation and Digital Identity\nNext Post\nWhy You Come, Why You Stay\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

Week 0 is just a fun name to give the time before the learning community activities actually start where we will give some orientation information. Note that Week 0 is five pages on this site which are linked at the end of each page and in the menu above.\nThere are no topical readings or planned group activities during Week 0 but there are a few housekeeping things that would be great if you could get out of the way during Week 0:\nRead through the Week 0 pages. Hey look! You’ve already started.\nSign up for our Slack workspace. Click the link in the “Welcome to #DigPINS” email from me – Slack will be our main form of communication so let me know if you need help with this.\nThe Doodle poll is now closed. You will receive a calendar invite from me for our Week 1 call!\nFill out this doodle poll.\nWe are planning a video call during week one between all of the partner schools. We know we won’t be able to get a time that will work for everyone but we will base the time on what will work for most from the results of this doodle poll. If you could take a moment to fill it out during this week that would be great!\nBuilding an Online Community\nIn the weeks that follow we will explore the possibilities of using digital tools to extend, expand, and further connect our community to each other and beyond. Community does not build itself and your participation in our various environments is what will make this experiences successful. You may find that you feel more comfortable in some environments than in others – this is natural and normal in digital spaces. Share your impressions and thoughts with our cohort or the larger network. Read what others are saying about their experiences and respond to them. It is these reflections and conversations that help us get to know one another.\nSetting Personal Goals\nHaving a clear goal is part of being successful in this kind of learning community. Yogi Berra once said, “you can observe a lot just by watching,” but we’d argue that you’ll learn more if you set some targets for tools you’d like to try out, topics you’d like to explore, or activities you’d like to do. So we encourage you, in these early weeks, to spend some time thinking about your goals for the next month of #DigPINS. You can share those goals on your blog post, in the backchannel, or privately with the facilitator or some other cohort members. A goal could be as simple as gathering in community with others in online environments to see what that’s like.\nThough there are no official “activities” for Week 0 we strongly recommend that you take this time to reflect on what you would like to get out of this experience. You may find that goals that you set for your experience here shift or change over time but setting a north star for yourself will help you to direct your experience and ask good questions that align with what is important. Having a clear goal is part of being successful in this kind of learning community. As Yogi Berra said, “you can observe a lot just by watching”, but you’ll learn more if you set some targets for tools you’d like to try out, topics you’d like to explore, or activities you’d like to do. So we encourage you to spend some time thinking about your goals for the next month of #DigPINS.\nA great way to get started is to post your goals as an introduction in Slack – our backchannel. Find out more about Slack on our\nDigital Tools page of Week 0\n.\nWorking in partnership\nNote that this site (snc.digpins.org) is the public hub for those participating in the St. Norbert College cohort but that we are working in a larger network.\nEach of our networked schools also have their own hub: American University in Cairo, Colgate University, Kenyon College, and University of Michigan – Dearborn all have public hubs of their own. You can visit these other hubs to read blog reflections from others working in other schools. You can also visit\ndiscuss.digpins.org\nwhich pulls in all of the blog posts from each of the schools into one place – currently there are posts from past #DigPINS cohorts but new posts will also be aggregated there.\nNote that the content info for each focus area (pedagogy, identity, networks, and scholarship) that lists activities and content may slightly differ between hubs. Cohorts will also author blog posts only on their public hub. Members of the SNC cohort will blog on this site.\nWeek 0 focus areas\nWeek 0 is broken up into four pages –\nOverview\n– What is this all about?\nStructure\n– What will we discuss over the course of #DigPINS? How is our time spent?\nParticipation\n– What does it mean to participate in a connected learning experience?\nDigital Tools\n– #DigPINS uses a variety of digital tools and this page has details about many of them."}

We are moving right along and once again thank you to everyone for your thoughts, insights, questions and comments as we work through our topics. This week we concentrate on the one everyone has been waiting for…\nDigital Pedagogy\nIt is important to recognize that\ndigital pedagogy\nis different from\nonline learning\n. Digital pedagogy can, and often does, take place in face to face courses but of course online learning is a form of digital pedagogy.\nSome of the guiding questions for this week are:\nHow do different digital spaces shape your teaching and students’ learning?\nWhat does “the digital” give to teaching and learning and what does it take away?\nHow do we create learning communities in online spaces?\nLet’s think for a moment about the digital spaces we have been using to communicate during DigPINS. Compare the style of say Slack Vs blogging style Vs Twitter style. Slack is often shorter messages but isn’t it interesting that, unlike Twitter, it is not because of an imposed character limit. The possibility for longer messages exists in Slack and it does happen but not as often. Slack, if you are using the app and get notifications, feels faster somehow. And what about blogging? Even when they are shorter blogs somehow feel more like a “conversation by letter” – email kind of feels that way too but email is more private (or at least it seems that way – though emails are forwarded with no notification all of the time).\nThe affordances and limitations of different tools – what they allow you to do and where they put up barriers – shape the way you present yourself, communicate, interact, and even just… are. So, of course they affect the way you teach. But this should not be a surprise, even our physical classrooms affect the way we teach. Is there a chalkboard or a whiteboard, does the furniture move, what is the lighting like? Answers to these questions impact how we teach and digital environments are no different.\nActivities\nContinue to Converse through Blog Posts and Slack\nWatch our welcome for the week\nAutumm Caines\nNo subscribers\nSubscribe\nPedagogy week digpins 2020\nWatch later\nShare\nCopy link\nInfo\nShopping\nTap to unmute\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\nYou're signed out\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

Will we be online or not, will students have reliable internet or not, will our students be experienced in online learning or not…? We are going to refer to these as spectrums of critical uncertainty and this exercise will explore them and challenge us to consider possible ways to affect them.\nIf you can make it to the sync meeting let us know if you will be coming by\nfilling out this short form\nTo start this activity we are asking you to identify a spectrum of critical uncertainty for fall of 2020.\nUse this doc\nto add your name to a spectrum that has been identified already or to create one of your own.\nTo work async feel free to dive in and\nuse this slide deck\nto map two critical uncertainties\nOn Thursday – sync: those who can attend our sync session will work in groups to map the spectrums and write about overlapping scenarios. The main session and break out groups will be recorded and added to a YouTube playlist.\nReadings:\nThere is a lot of information on digital pedagogy – we are providing you this list to get started.

Saying that, I also have to say that I am both impressed by, and overwhelmed by the various resources that are available. In a way the abundance of possibilities, which is certainly a positive, strikes at one of my weaknesses. That is, I love to explore all sorts of new and exciting formats but do not spend the time to master any one of them and rather, like a bumble bee, simply move from one approach to another not utilizing any one of them. This tendency reflects my basic aversion of recognizing limits but that goes into a philosophical discussion that will have to be postponed. Remembering a bit of advice I got from a colleague at the beginning of the Covid-19 lock down, I need to focus and select a few,  new techniques and incorporate them more integrally into the approach I have developed over the past few months. Having said that, and given the recognition of a spectrum of critical uncertainties that face us this upcoming fall, I plan on structuring my courses with an eye toward overall digital pedagogy of which online learning will be a part. Utilizing key activities from “Liberating Structures,” this approach enables me to think of my classes in a way that is not too overwhelming and will provide a framework that is portable from a f2f to total on-line format.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\n2\nbloggers\nlike this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nWhy You Come, Why You Stay\n(1) Comment\nTaylor\nJune 25, 2020 at 2:27 pm\nReply\nFacilitating an engaging discussion remotely can be difficult and requires intentional design.

There are some amazing people doing digital scholarship on Twitter in both Classics (\nSententiae Antiquae\n) and Mesopotamian culture (\nDr. Moudhy Al-Rashid\n) among others. I thought about trying to make and maintain\nTwitter lists\n, but I’m not really a list maintainer (I mean, I can\nmake\nthem, no problem!).\nOn the personal side of my Tweets, lots of them were political, with others revolving around sports, movies, and just general goofiness. I used gocardigan to delete my tweets every three months or so. This system worked pretty well for me, for the most part.\nThat was until this past 27 May and the murder of George Floyd. As a straight, cis, white male academic with tenure, I finally brought myself to as rigorous an examination of my privilege and apathy as I’ve ever had in my life. I’ve begun the long-term work to change my habits and dispositions in a variety of ways–what I read, what I teach, how I teach, and how/what I use my social media for.\nIn the Twitterverse, that meant changing my timeline. I began to follow a number of accounts of Black authors, scholars, and activists. With but a few exception, I’ve dedicated my own timeline to issues of structural racism in America (and in the American Catholic Church), police brutality, Whiteness, and the need for just social and economic structures in my country.\nTwitter is my main news source (for better and for worse). I read, tweet, and RT quite a bit everyday. So, changing the content of what I see on Twitter is not a minor thing for me, because now I’m seeing, reading, and interacting with a lot of people and ideas that I’d otherwise would not have known.\nThe rather obvious, but really significant takeaway for me is this: I\ncame\nto Twitter seeking out people like me. Now I\nstay\non Twitter for the absolutely essential need\nto listen to people who aren’t like me\n. These first, small steps are part of a larger project of trying to be part of a network where I decenter myself.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\n3\nbloggers\nlike this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nWhere’s the Poetry?\nNext Post\nDigital Pedagogy\n(2) Comments\nHoward Ebert\nJune 18, 2020 at 3:14 pm\nReply\nTom, I love your blog.

This of course will vary from discipline to discipline and field to field, so a rich conversation will be needed for us to understand each other’s perspectives. Chime in! Questions to consider:\nWho reads the scholarly work in your field?\nAre there important forms of communication in your field which you don’t think of as “scholarship”?\nHow much of scholarly work in your field is available for those outside your field to access but also to understand?\nWhy would or wouldn’t this matter?\nWhat impact does our scholarship have on those outside of our respective fields, in academia but also in the general public, and what is our responsibility to those people?\nThings to do this week:\nContinue the conversation!\nContinue to post questions and reflections, and listen and respond to others, on the blog, on Twitter, and in Slack.\nThere are three readings this week.\nThe first, by Leila Walker, is about what social media has to do with scholarship. Then Rick Anderson discusses what we could do to make open access scholarship more comprehensible to audiences outside the research field. And finally, from Tressie McMillan Cottom, we’ve got a blog post reflection on what institutions need to have prepared to support the inevitable controversies which public scholarship can cause. We also have an optional reading from Jim Ottaviani which attempts to measure the way that open access archives of scholarship increase the reach and life span of that research. This one does get a little technical in the middle; remember that it’s not a short story and you can skip to the end.\nHypothes.is annotation\n– this week we’ll be looking at social annotation as a way of tracking and sharing research online. We’ll be using the\nHypothes.is\ntool which allows you to highlight and make notes on a web page while you read it. This is a tool you can use privately, in small groups, or as we will, in the open.\nFill out DigPINS SNC Wrap-up Doodle poll\n– I am planning on having the SNC cohort meet for a quick video call near the end of next week to put a bow on our DigPINS experience.\nVisit this link to pick whichever times work with your schedule.\nIf none of the time work for you, that’s ok, let me know if you’d like to meet individually!\nWhat we’re asking you to do this week is to make and share annotations on our readings. Look for passages which:\nHelp or complicate your understanding of the argument in the reading,\nConnect to other articles – you can\nlink\nto them in your annotation,\nResonate with your practice, or your institutional environment,\nOr prompt you to ask a question.\nDon’t forget to look over other people’s annotations – you can reply to them and have a whole conversation in the margins!\nRemember that along with (or instead of) a narrative annotation, you can add tags to your selected passages. This allows you to use Hypothesis as a powerful research tool, the electronic equivalent of sortable note cards. You can browse your own tags to see patterns developing across documents. You can also browse all public uses of a tag (like this view of the\nDigPINS\ntag) to see what other people have found relevant to that topic.\nYou’ll need to\nregister for a Hypothesis account\n. We really like the\nBookmarklet\nor\nChrome extension\nbut if you don’t want to install them you can use Hypothesis by attaching\nvia.hypothes.is\nto the beginning of any URL. Autumm\nmade a video\nlast summer to help introduce some of the Hypothesis features.\nContent for This Week:\nBeyond Academic Twitter: Social Media and the Evolution of Scholarly Publication\n– Leila Walker (\nHypothesis link\n)\nAccess vs. Accessibility in Scholarship and Science\n– Rick Anderson (\nHypothesis link\n)\nEverything But The Burden: Publics, Public Scholarship, and Institutions\n– Tressie McMillan Cottom  (\nHypothesis link\n)\nLooking for more?\nThe Post-Embargo Open Access Citation Advantage: It Exists (Probably), It’s Modest (Usually), and the Rich Get Richer (of Course)\n– Jim Ottaviani (\nHypothesis link\n)"}
{"id":"1d34a565-e3d7-476d-880c-baf86823f3bf","url":"https://snc.digpins.org/week-1-digital-identity","title":"Week 1: Digital Identity – SNC #DigPINS","text":"Home\n>\nWeek 1: Digital Identity\nWeek 1 Starts June 1st!\nWelcome to the first week of #DigPINS – Digital Identity\nHey – Welcome to week 1 – This week we invite you to engage with ideas around digital identity. We have activities, readings, and a video call this week. Each week we encourage you to blog about your thoughts from that week’s interactions and to engage with one another in our Slack channels.\nBefore you can interact with others in a digital space you need an identity of some kind yourself. Digital environments allow people to express and portray themselves in a myriad of ways. Sometimes digital spaces are used to paint authentic reflections of self but they can also be used to create new identities. Identities do not have to be that of an individual and often they are not.\nIf you did not get a chance to review\nweek 0 materials\nthat is okay but for this week you should be sure that at minimum you have access to Slack and this blog. More info on that is found on the\ndigital tools page of Week 0\n.\nSet goals for yourself\nHaving a clear goal is part of being successful in this kind of learning community. Yogi Berra once said, “\nyou can observe a lot just by watching\n,” but we’d argue that you’ll learn more if you set some targets for tools you’d like to try out, topics you’d like to explore, or activities you’d like to do. So we encourage you, in these early weeks, to spend some time thinking about your goals for the next month of #DigPINS. You can share those goals on your blog post, in the backchannel, or privately with the facilitator or some other cohort members. A goal could be as simple as gathering in community with others in online environments to see what that’s like.\nDigital Identity\n#DigPINS starts with an exploration / reflection on one’s own digital identity(s). Together, we will think about and discuss the digital identities that we have or would like to develop. We are not going to encourage a “right way” to form a digital identity. Rather, we will each share what spaces we occupy online and we will discuss what has worked for each person, what hasn’t, what fears we may have, and possible ideal identities for given contexts, as well as what we would like to avoid.\nSome of the guiding questions include:\nHow do you portray yourself in different online spaces?\nHow does a digital environment shape the way you can portray yourself?\nWhat social traces do you leave when you are on the web?\nHow would you like to start / continue curating or shaping your digital presence and identity?\nThis Week’s Activities, Readings, etc.\nThis week think about how you are going to get to know the others in our group. When we share physical space we don’t need to think about this as much or do as much. We send subtle cues about who we are by the way that we dress, the way we hold ourselves, the way we decorate our spaces, etc. In a digital space we have to think a little more about these things and try to send those signals in other ways. Consider updating your Slack profile with the name of your school and your role. Add a picture to your profile – not comfortable sharing a picture of your face – that is okay, choose another picture that you can identify with in some way.\nMajor Content for this Week:\nRead\nWhy Academics Need a Digital Persona\n– Laura Pasquini\nRead\nIn Praise of Living in Public\n(this article is a great introduction to the idea of context collapse) – Bonnie Stewart\nView this welcome video\nfrom the facilitators\nTaylor Jadin\n15 subscribers\nSubscribe\nWeek 1: Digital Identity - #DigPINS Summer 2020\nWatch later\nShare\nCopy link\nInfo\nShopping\nTap to unmute\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\nYou're signed out\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

You can choose how you would like to make it but I recommend that you just draw it out on paper and then take a picture of it to share it with us. You may already have more than one digital identity if you maintain an identity for a business or project – feel free to map whichever identity you feel you would like to explore. At minimum share it in our Slack #week-1-identity channel but if you are looking to share more broadly post it on Twitter using our hashtag #DigPINS.*Optional but very cool – If you are looking to go even further with exploring your digital identity some of the originators of the V&R mapping have moved away from V&R and started a new mapping process they are calling the\nDigital Practice Triangle\n. How does the triangle compare to the 2×2 matrix?\nSync Video Call\n– We have two dates\nTuesday June 2nd at 9am and Wednesday June 3rd at 11am\n– (thank you everyone who filled out the Doodle poll). To keep the calls balanced in terms of numbers we have divided the group in two. You should have a calendar invite with your call time. We will be using activities from the\nLiberating Structures\nfor these meetings.\nBlogging\n–  Write a blog post here on snc.digpins.org (by the end of the week or even into the start of next week) with the #DigPINS community as your intended audience\nWhat to write about?\nThis week’s post can be a response or reflection to the readings, the visitor / resident activity, a conversation from slack, or anything else you find related – maybe something happened in your life this week or in the news that you find is related to “digital identity”. If you are having trouble picking a topic maybe think about posting to Slack to ask for some ideas. You can reflect in many ways (writing is only one), maybe, consider a video response – there are no word limits or maximus but remember your audience probably wants something in the middle (not too long or too short). Part of “blogging” is also reading and commenting on others’ posts so don’t forget to do that and remember the posts from all of the cohorts from all five schools is at\ndiscuss.digpins.org\n. Once you create a new post don’t forget to promote your post in Slack or on Twitter – no one knows that you have posted unless you tell them.\nIntroduce yourself in Slack\n– By now you should have access to our Slack team. To get started introduce yourself with a few sentences around who you are and why you are interested in #DigPINS in the #common-room channel in Slack.\nNote that Slack will be our main mode of communication. To get the most out of this experience you should check it daily.\nIf you feel comfortable, the best way to stay in contact is to download the app and make sure the notifications are turned on.\nSome things you could/should use Slack for:\n– Posting quick informal thoughts on readings or concepts\n– Responding to others’ quick informal thoughts\n– Sharing other articles, videos, or podcasts that you come across\n– Promoting your blog post each week\n– Being notified that others have posted blog articles\n– Asking and answering questions\nTwitter\n– think about a twitter handle and\nsign up for twitter\nif you don’t already have one. Not sure what you want your twitter handle to be? Maybe bring that up for discussion in Slack. Remember that Twitter is a public forum.\nLooking for More / Stuff to bookmark for later?\nWe only have so much time and #DigPINS is designed to be a quick and low-time commitment kind of experience. Digital Identity is a huge topic and if you are looking for more information\nthis curation of articles, tools, repositories, platforms, and security and privacy resources\nby\nLee Skallerup Bessette\nfrom a recent workshop that she led at the Digital Humanities Summer Institute is a great resource."}

A large portion of my job involves meeting with faculty and staff at the college, helping out with or facilitating different activities in classes, and participating in other various meetings. Obviously all of that is has been happening online now since March.\nTo make sure people can hear me clearly on video calls I have been using different headsets and microphones instead of the built in microphone on my laptop. One of the things I love about the headset I use most often is that it has a built in mute switch.\nI like the mute switch on my headset because it is a physical switch that I can use to mute my microphone quickly and easily. I can find and discretely flip this switch without looking at it, and I can tell just by touching it whether I am muted or not, it is really convenient.\nOn occasion I use an actual microphone for video calls and the device that the microphone plugs in to has a gain knob which is convenient for the same reasons as that mute switch:\nAs much as I like being able to turn on and off my mic this way, in certain contexts I’ve gone back to using the software mute button in Google Meet / Zoom / whichevervideoplatform. I’ve done this because I believe that the built in visible mute indicator built in to all these video platforms has started to become a form of non-verbal communication.\nI’ve been a part of more than one video call where Person A is doing most of the talking in a meeting while Person B and Person C are muted. Suddenly Person B clicks that unmute button, the\ndisappears, and Person A stops talking and says something to the effect of “Person B, do you have something to add?”\nThis might sound unremarkable, but it is particularly interesting to me because of how many social cues don’t work, or are hard/impossible to notice over video calls. In a face to face conversation, body language, taking a breath, facial expressions, or any number of other non-verbal cues might indicate that someone would like to speak. We make due without these on video calls, but this is one tool that we have on video calls that we don’t have in person.\nI think I might need to give up my physical mute switch and get used to hauling my cursor across the screen and over to the toolbar and clicking that mute button.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nContext Collapse and Reintegrating with the Matrix…\nNext Post\nMoral Transformation and Digital Identity\n(2) Comments\nJennifer Nissen\nJune 9, 2020 at 2:13 pm\nReply\nTaylor, thanks for the great tips!

I used to blog all the time and, as far as I can recall, it’s probably been 8 years since I’ve made a personal blog post. A part of it was simply retreating from a life surrounded by complete technology (I worked remotely in web development for many years) and another was trying to keep some kind of control over what was represented about me online. I tell my kids to consider anything they’ve put out online to be permanent and fully represent them in any misconstrued context that could possibly be imagined. It’s the most pragmatic way to proceed. All that said, for the past couple years I’ve been subtly reaching for a way to send something back out there, to reestablish a necessary connection, and I think our cohort will be very helpful in that endeavor (So, thank you, again!). Along these lines, Pasquini’s notion that our online presence is as ‘real’ as our tangible, physical existence is an interesting one that I plan to pursue and consider in the coming weeks.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nMultiple Identities Take Work!\nNext Post\nThe mute button\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\nWrite a Comment...\nEmail (Required)\nName (Required)\nWebsite\nLoading Comments...\nComment\n×\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

I comment on Reddit, post to Instagram, on Facebook I create invites to exhibitions and have pics of my garden and daughter. These don’t even consider the spaces I created. Artist friends work tirelessly at maintaining a strong and focused presence on multiple platforms, but the work involved is pretty daunting to sustain. As an artist, a digital presence is critical, but takes work and is about as exciting as cleaning out the refrigerator. I definitely have a few dead blogs and a website that needs updating. I guess my identities include teacher, artist and personal. The teacher and artist parts really come together and sometimes merge with the personal just so people know I am human. I think the digital space takes work, but can be anything you want it to be. Sometimes just creating a space for students is rewarding and learning for me.

Although you meant it as a comparison to how exciting that process is, I actually think it’s been helpful for me to think of posts or platforms as items I’m putting into a cupboard or display board and then I can reconfigure them or eliminate some if their shelf lives expire. They’re not sorts of time capsules I need to hang onto or keep online forever, frozen in time.

One has me not worried in the slightest; the other–well– it has me worried quite a bit about what it means not only for professional development and what it means for thinking about the relationship between privacy and the perspective that views education primarily as character formation.\nWhy I’m not worried at all: context collapse, as Bonnie Stewart judges, is inevitable, and I think there’s good reason to greet the inevitable with an embrace of welcome and an eye towards sifting out opportunities for transformative, sustainable change. Whether the line is invisible (as is the case for the person living with a pacemaker), or visible (consider, for example, the person who uses a prosthetic limb), or completely imaginary (as happens to many of us when we believe we are sensing our phones vibrating or or hearing them ring, when in fact they aren’t), the line between the technologies we use and the persons we are is dissolving before our eyes. (I’m also wearing contact lenses right now, which only to me reinforces the point.) Moreover, I also think that dissolving that line is exactly what all good technologies should do, or they wouldn’t be worth inventing. After all, when I write something (like this post, even), I am placing myself “in front of you” as a reader, providing a representation of myself that is inevitably stylized. This allows “me” to be multiple places at once, and–as long as servers survive–“I’ll” be alive forever. Digital presences–whether fostered by LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, or some other platform–seem by my assessment to do pretty much the same thing, at least in this respect.\nNow, from another angle, I think there might be some reasons to be concerned about context collapse. One is that there may be in some cases good reason for cultivating multiple, perhaps even contradictory, digital identities. One reason: the preservation of privacy. I think it’s simply the case that not everything about one’s life is relevant for people to know. In many cases, my employer should be be able to find out if I’m doing an exceptionally good job in rendering service to the profession; on the other hand, there’s no reason in hell why that same entity should be aware of whether or not I’m a nudist anarchist who makes posts to that effect on various platforms. Another reason: awareness of how social power in a racialized system punishes. It seems unfortunately true that many scholars-of-color render themselves complicit in the very academic structures that they identify as oppressive, though it might not be safe for their employers to know that they are working to dismantle those very structures.\nBut, the main reason why I think we should be concerned about context collapse is that I’m not sure that we can do the work of transformative learning–whether as those who undergo professional development or as those who educate others–without these sorts of private spaces.\nThe condition for the possibility of learning, it seems to me, is trust. Yet this is one of the crucial things that cannot be guaranteed with a credential or with a terminal degree. It can be validated only in the context of a relationship that grows over time. But if this is the case–if, indeed, education is a temporal process–then, choosing to document that process (whether we do that with discussion boards, journal entries, or some other artifact) will be a choice to document our own transformation.\nNow, there will certainly be cases where this poses no major concern. A documented history of wrong answers in say, math classes, can easily turn into a badge of honor when one begins to produce the right answers. But what about courses or professional development modules where we are learning about–or, perhaps more importantly, where we are\nunlearning\n–the sexisms, racisms, and homophobias that provided the backgrounds to our intuitions about fairness, honesty, and responsibility? In these situations, the dangers of context collapse–the danger of being unable to have a cordoned-off digital identity where one is a student learning to dismantle the effects of these systemic oppressions–are most palpable.\nIn other words, if we are going to learn in a world like our own, where context collapse is inevitable because the lines between our digital selves and the technologies we use to mediate ourselves is collapsing, we need nevertheless to create spaces to fail, spaces without collapse. Otherwise the fear of a public dragging will lead not only to a resistance to the learning process itself, but also to the arrival of the most demonic of rationalizations for that resistance: that because we teach our students (rightly) that some of the ways in which they have been educated in the past reflect the workings of ideology, they draw the conclusion that all forms of education–even transformative ones–are necessarily ideological. That is too high of a price to pay if we want to build a better world; if we want to build a world where #blacklivesmatter; if we want to build a world where all those, regardless of gender and sexual identity, are given the most basic and beautiful gifts of pride and self-respect.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nThe mute button\nNext Post\nWhere’s the Poetry?\n(1) Comment\nThomas Bolin\nJune 9, 2020 at 8:42 pm\nReply\nCraig, your point about reasons to have some sort of separation, to avoid context collapse, as essential in allowing people to work through and work out their moral growth is important and overlooked.

Like others, I sometimes hesitate to share things online. However, I think this reluctance is subconscious, at least in the case of personal postings. On personal platforms I should be comfortable with my audience since it is made up of mostly friends and family. I saw an Instagram post talking about how hesitating to share in personal spaces can be related to fear of “getting political” or being judged by peers. Both of these situations encourage a reevaluation of your personal online space and who that space is shared with. Since many people distinguish between personal and institutional platforms, I think it’s important to be comfortable online in our personal spaces, especially for those just establishing a digital presence.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nDigital Identity\nNext Post\nMultiple Identities Take Work!\n(1) Comment\nDebbie Kupinsky\nJune 7, 2020 at 6:05 pm\nReply\nI totally understand not wanting controversy, but the space can be anything you want it to be.

Bonnie Stewart’s post really hit home when she talked about moribund blogs, because I have one! Regarding blogs and identity, Stewart notes, “You have to cobble that self together from the nearly infinite contexts and selves reflected back at you by the disco ball of the blank screen. It’s what makes the dead-letter pile of all the millions of blogs choking the internet.” I felt seen.\nI made list of all the places that I could think of where I’m digitally present:\nTwitter\n, Facebook, Instagram, my\nblog\n,\nHumanities Commons\n(a place for academics to share their research) Loom, some online publications,\nmy CV\n, Google Docs.\nDave White’s model of visitor-resident as a replacement to immigrant-native is\nreally important\n. I’ll be using these categories in my classroom, and especially when I talk with administrators about our students. The map I made brought something to light I hadn’t though about before.\nWhat struck me is that I’m rarely a visitor online. I put Instagram on the boundary because I don’t look at posts from people whom I don’t follow, and I only follow friends. Twitter and Facebook, however, are good examples of Bonnie Stewart’s collapsed contexts, especially Twitter. My account isn’t private and, while I do present an “academic” face I also tweet about lots of other things, serious and whimsical. Given that most of my interactions are with other academics, I know that I’m pretty typical. On Facebook, I have many academic friends whom I’ve never met “IRL” but with whom I have collaborated on writing projects, conferences, etc.\nIn my discipline, we have a whole section in our scholarship statement about the importance of public scholarship, and that’s something that I think informs part of my digital identity.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\n2\nbloggers\nlike this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nIs there anybody out there, just nod if you can hear me!\nNext Post\nDigital Identity\n(2) Comments\nTaylor\nJune 3, 2020 at 5:22 pm\nReply\nI’m glad to read that you resonated with the Visitor Resident model, in my experience the digital native way of thinking can sometimes lead to assuming  students just “know this stuff” when using different digital platforms, thinking about identity etc. In my opinion this is often not the case.\nI’ve helped a few faculty do V&R mapping in courses that had public writing components, and students seem to often find it useful!\nDiana VB\nJune 4, 2020 at 6:18 pm\nI found the readings insightful as well. In looking at your map on slack and before reading your post, the first thought that came to mind was of a robust resident – balanced between both professional and personal worlds. Your post seems to say as much. As I tend towards the visitor/reluctant resident end of the spectrum I appreciate your embrace of the resident space especially that it also suggests possibility.  Visual representations do carry their own power.\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\nWrite a Comment...\nEmail (Required)\nName (Required)\nWebsite\nLoading Comments...\nComment\n×\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

My participation in social media is very limited. Yes, I am on twitter, facebook, and on instagram. My presence on these social platforms is minimal. I check them once in a great while. In fact, I got on them because others (e.g., administrative assistant, students) thought I should be on them and signed me up!

To that end, at this point, I see  my digital identity as focused on facilitating better communication with my students and among them. The reading and exercises we did online drawn from the “liberating structures” approach helped me see how I can facilitate on line discussions that are inclusive and productive.

The professor and TA’s not only engaged in online discussions with\nstudents but went beyond by creating interactive assignments and activities. This\nwas a pioneering project at the time and it seemed to be a favorite among undergraduate\nstudents. It was a virtual interactive game where students would create their\nown avatar and immerse in a group of missions. Each avatar would need to\ncomplete certain steps to move on to the next level and the success relied on\ntheir knowledge of the material being studied. The physical environment and\nlevel of difficulty changed according to the subject and the level of the\ncourse. In answering questions, avatars would gain certain tools that advanced their\nmission.\nAt first, I was skeptical about this activity, I had seen my\nyounger siblings playing similar games and they just didn’t seem educational.\nHowever, I was completely wrong, many of these games are educational because\nthey require people to think critically and perform certain tasks. In this\ncourse, students not only did all the readings but went beyond by doing their\nown research outside of class. I just felt in love with digital learning, we were\nconnecting with our students and they were genuinely interested in the course. It\nwas a success!\nHowever, it was also very stressful for us. The many programs\nand platforms that we had to use and the endless technical errors we didn’t\nknow how fix were our major challenges. The professor and the TA’s were\nconstantly meeting with IT to resolve these issues and many times the solutions\nweren’t simple. Also, our challenges grew with the development of the program.\nIn the future, I would like to pursue creating a similar online\ninteractive experience in my Latin American Civilization and Culture course,\nhowever, this would be a long-term project that I would need to develop in\ncollaboration with colleagues and students. I am excited for the opportunity to\nexplore new horizons that will allow me to connect with my students outside of\na traditional classroom and in exciting new spaces.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nReflections on Digital Pedagogy and Digital Spaces\nNext Post\nBeing Gullible in a World Filled with Fake News\n(4) Comments\nKatie G\nJanuary 26, 2019 at 2:42 pm\nReply\nJudy,\nThis project sounds fantastic! Did the students interact with each other while online? It sounds like an amazing experience for everyone involved! I really like the way that it adds a game element to the class.

Have they made any substantial modifications to it?\nReid\nJanuary 26, 2019 at 3:15 pm\nReply\nThis is exciting Judy.  I have been interested in finding ways to use interactive games and simulations at the college.  I would like to hear more about how this simulation game was set up.  Was it designed by local folks, or did you work with a provider?\nJudy Cervantes\nJanuary 31, 2019 at 1:52 am\nReid, it was so much fun! The game was designed by the professor and 2 TA’s that were technology savvy. The team worked with Creative Commons for licensing. Similar assignments at SNC would be a success with our students.\nJudy Cervantes\nJanuary 31, 2019 at 1:45 am\nReply\nKatie, at the time students did not interact but it was a feature desired for upcoming courses. The online history class is still offered, however, a lot of positive changes have occurred since I was last involved. The team has improved the quality of the online platform and more online assignments have been included.\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\nWrite a Comment...\nEmail (Required)\nName (Required)\nWebsite\nLoading Comments...\nComment\n×\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

Week 0 is just a fun name to give the time before the learning community activities actually start where we will give some orientation information. Note that Week 0 is five pages on this site which are linked at the end of each page and in the menu above.\nThere are no topical readings or planned group activities during Week 0 but there are a few housekeeping things that would be great if you could get out of the way during Week 0:\nRead through the Week 0 pages. Hey look! You’ve already started.\nSign up for our Slack workspace. Click the link in the “Welcome to #DigPINS” email from me – Slack will be our main form of communication so let me know if you need help with this.\nThe Doodle poll is now closed. You will receive a calendar invite from me for our Week 1 call!\nFill out this doodle poll.\nWe are planning a video call during week one between all of the partner schools. We know we won’t be able to get a time that will work for everyone but we will base the time on what will work for most from the results of this doodle poll. If you could take a moment to fill it out during this week that would be great!\nBuilding an Online Community\nIn the weeks that follow we will explore the possibilities of using digital tools to extend, expand, and further connect our community to each other and beyond. Community does not build itself and your participation in our various environments is what will make this experiences successful. You may find that you feel more comfortable in some environments than in others – this is natural and normal in digital spaces. Share your impressions and thoughts with our cohort or the larger network. Read what others are saying about their experiences and respond to them. It is these reflections and conversations that help us get to know one another.\nSetting Personal Goals\nHaving a clear goal is part of being successful in this kind of learning community. Yogi Berra once said, “you can observe a lot just by watching,” but we’d argue that you’ll learn more if you set some targets for tools you’d like to try out, topics you’d like to explore, or activities you’d like to do. So we encourage you, in these early weeks, to spend some time thinking about your goals for the next month of #DigPINS. You can share those goals on your blog post, in the backchannel, or privately with the facilitator or some other cohort members. A goal could be as simple as gathering in community with others in online environments to see what that’s like.\nThough there are no official “activities” for Week 0 we strongly recommend that you take this time to reflect on what you would like to get out of this experience. You may find that goals that you set for your experience here shift or change over time but setting a north star for yourself will help you to direct your experience and ask good questions that align with what is important. Having a clear goal is part of being successful in this kind of learning community. As Yogi Berra said, “you can observe a lot just by watching”, but you’ll learn more if you set some targets for tools you’d like to try out, topics you’d like to explore, or activities you’d like to do. So we encourage you to spend some time thinking about your goals for the next month of #DigPINS.\nA great way to get started is to post your goals as an introduction in Slack – our backchannel. Find out more about Slack on our\nDigital Tools page of Week 0\n.\nWorking in partnership\nNote that this site (snc.digpins.org) is the public hub for those participating in the St. Norbert College cohort but that we are working in a larger network.\nEach of our networked schools also have their own hub: American University in Cairo, Colgate University, Kenyon College, and University of Michigan – Dearborn all have public hubs of their own. You can visit these other hubs to read blog reflections from others working in other schools. You can also visit\ndiscuss.digpins.org\nwhich pulls in all of the blog posts from each of the schools into one place – currently there are posts from past #DigPINS cohorts but new posts will also be aggregated there.\nNote that the content info for each focus area (pedagogy, identity, networks, and scholarship) that lists activities and content may slightly differ between hubs. Cohorts will also author blog posts only on their public hub.

We’re using the hashtag\n#DigPINS\nto collect our relevant tweets. By looking at a hashtag, you can find people talking about the same topic or event whom you might not follow yet. Just pop the hashtag into the search box in Twitter to see the conversation. You also might try hashtags like\n#DigCiz\nor\n#AcDigID\nfor conversations adjacent to ours. (Notes: Twitter presents the ‘Top’ search results first; you need to click ‘Latest’ to see chronological order. Also, cases do not matter for hashtags, but mixed case can make them easier to read.)"}

This of course will vary from discipline to discipline and field to field, so a rich conversation will be needed for us to understand each other’s perspectives. Chime in! Questions to consider:\nWho reads the scholarly work in your field?\nAre there important forms of communication in your field which you don’t think of as “scholarship”?\nHow much of scholarly work in your field is available for those outside your field to access but also to understand?\nWhy would or wouldn’t this matter?\nWhat impact does our scholarship have on those outside of our respective fields, in academia but also in the general public, and what is our responsibility to those people?\nThings to do this week:\nContinue the conversation!\nContinue to post questions and reflections, and listen and respond to others, on the blog, on Twitter, and in Slack.\nThere are three readings this week.\nThe first, by Leila Walker, is about what social media has to do with scholarship. Then Rick Anderson discusses what we could do to make open access scholarship more comprehensible to audiences outside the research field. And finally, from Tressie McMillan Cottom, we’ve got a blog post reflection on what institutions need to have prepared to support the inevitable controversies which public scholarship can cause. We also have an optional reading from Jim Ottaviani which attempts to measure the way that open access archives of scholarship increase the reach and life span of that research. This one does get a little technical in the middle; remember that it’s not a short story and you can skip to the end.\nHypothes.is annotation\n– this week we’ll be looking at social annotation as a way of tracking and sharing research online. We’ll be using the\nHypothes.is\ntool which allows you to highlight and make notes on a web page while you read it. This is a tool you can use privately, in small groups, or as we will, in the open.\nFill out DigPINS SNC Wrap-up Doodle poll\n– I am planning on having the SNC cohort meet for a quick video call near the end of next week to put a bow on our DigPINS experience.\nVisit this link to pick whichever times work with your schedule.\nIf none of the time work for you, that’s ok, let me know if you’d like to meet individually!\nWhat we’re asking you to do this week is to make and share annotations on our readings. Look for passages which:\nHelp or complicate your understanding of the argument in the reading,\nConnect to other articles – you can\nlink\nto them in your annotation,\nResonate with your practice, or your institutional environment,\nOr prompt you to ask a question.\nDon’t forget to look over other people’s annotations – you can reply to them and have a whole conversation in the margins!\nRemember that along with (or instead of) a narrative annotation, you can add tags to your selected passages. This allows you to use Hypothesis as a powerful research tool, the electronic equivalent of sortable note cards. You can browse your own tags to see patterns developing across documents. You can also browse all public uses of a tag (like this view of the\nDigPINS\ntag) to see what other people have found relevant to that topic.\nYou’ll need to\nregister for a Hypothesis account\n. We really like the\nBookmarklet\nor\nChrome extension\nbut if you don’t want to install them you can use Hypothesis by attaching\nvia.hypothes.is\nto the beginning of any URL. Autumm\nmade a video\nlast summer to help introduce some of the Hypothesis features.\nContent for This Week:\nBeyond Academic Twitter: Social Media and the Evolution of Scholarly Publication\n– Leila Walker (\nHypothesis link\n)\nAccess vs. Accessibility in Scholarship and Science\n– Rick Anderson (\nHypothesis link\n)\nEverything But The Burden: Publics, Public Scholarship, and Institutions\n– Tressie McMillan Cottom  (\nHypothesis link\n)\nLooking for more?\nThe Post-Embargo Open Access Citation Advantage: It Exists (Probably), It’s Modest (Usually), and the Rich Get Richer (of Course)\n– Jim Ottaviani (\nHypothesis link\n)"}

Then check out who they follow, the hashtags they use, etc. Connect with ones that you feel an affinity towards. (Or, going back to our Identity week, think about spaces where you’re already connecting with your professional communities, and how you might engage in those networks differently.)\nOur examples this week will focus on Twitter, but if you discover useful groups on other platforms (like Slack or Discord or Facebook or good old blogs and email!), think about how they fit into your developing digital identity.\nCheck out the list of suggested twitter accounts\n(and hashtags) from the #DigPINS facilitators – follow accounts that look interesting to you.\nTweet using #DigPINS –\nWe do want to continue having conversations in Slack and on the blog, but this week you should start working in the public more.\n(Disclaimer: if you have concerns about working in the public due to security or privacy talk to me).\nMaybe consider not just promoting your blog post in Slack but posting it to Twitter – don’t forget to tag #DigPINS. Our main prompt for the week is to consider people and environments for building your PLN and share your process for finding and connecting with them. And of course, people who have participated in\n#DigPINS\nin the past might be good folks to connect to! You can identify past participants by searching for\n#DigPINS\non Twitter and scrolling through the search results.\nJoin our Digital Scavenger Hunt!\nEvery day this week, one of the facilitators will post a scavenger hunt goal for the day. Your mission will be to:\nShare\nwhat you find for each day’s prompt.\nCheck\nthe #DigPINS hashtag to see what other people are finding, and respond to someone each day.\nOver the course of the week,\nquote\nsomeone’s response, adding a comment or question.\nOver the course of the week, send a\nprivate message\nto one of the facilitators, and we will reply. Twitter doesn’t only have to be in the public timeline, the Direct Message (or DM) feature works more like texting an individual or small group.\nCheck your Twitter “notifications”\nto see what conversations you have been mentioned or tagged in. Respond to any notifications that you feel compelled to, and consider retweeting tweets you think are pertinent.  Add your ideas via tweet to the growing conversation.\nAlways remember to add the #DigPINS hashtag.\nWe’ve imagined this as primarily an activity to get you used to Twitter, but if you’re not ready for that yet, or if any given prompt feels like something you’d prefer to keep privateyc, you can respond in Slack instead of on Twitter.“\nPlay\n” the Nicky Case narrative game\nThe Wisdom and/or Madness of Crowds\nto dip your toe into the world of network science. We use this “explainer” to start conversations about information literacy in networks; it should prompt some thoughts about how you want to tune your networks to bring in the kinds of information you want and need, and be resilient against “fake news.” You may also think about what kind of role you play (or might want to play) in your networks (e.g. fostering bonding and/or bridging ties between your networks). (There are lots of neat extra resources linked in this game; feel free not to follow every footnote. Unless you want to!)\nOptional: if you enjoy this, Case has recently released an explainer on\nfuture COVID-19 scenarios\n.

{"id":"e12b6e7c-a92d-41b2-91c6-e9e4ce18ff36","url":"https://snc.digpins.org/week-0-participation/","title":"Week 0: Participation – SNC #DigPINS","text":"Home\n>\nWeek 0: Participation\nParticipation is the heart of #DigPINS. Yes there is content, but the learning community does not function without participation.\nSync to Async\nYour time spent on participation will be spent on asynchronous communications (compose, post, wait, get responses) like blogging and commenting as well as synchronous activities (real-time) such as video calls.\nSynchronous online activities are scheduled through a poll of participant availability. Inevitably, finding a time that works for everyone is difficult but multiple meetings are offered to try to give everyone both synchronous and asynchronous experiences. When a synchronous meeting time does not work for a participant, facilitators encourage them to be creative with finding asynchronous ways to engage the community in the topic.\nBackchannel to Public\n#DigPINS also blends the range of public context in which participants work over public and more closed spaces. This simply means that some online environments will be more open and public than others. For example posting to the blog is an open and public space that can be viewed by anyone with the URL while communications in Slack are invite only. Our SNC cohort will have our own Slack channel and our partner cohorts will also have their own backchannels. Additionally, Slack provides a place for one to one communication between individuals – direct message.\nTheory\nHeutagogy: Self-directed learning\nI’m sure that you have heard of pedagogy – which (in case you haven’t) technically means the teaching of children though in higher education we use it as a catch all term for teaching in general. However, have you heard of heutagogy? Heutagogy is a different approach where learners are more autonomous and self-directed; it is not for every learning experience but it is part of the adult learning theories.\nThough #DigPINS is not a “course” we are a cohort group who are learning together outside of a traditional course or classroom and heutagogy is an interesting way to frame this kind of learning.\n“A heutagogical approach recognises the need to be flexible in the learning where the teacher provides resources but the learner designs the actual course he or she might take by negotiating the learning. Thus learners might read around critical issues or questions and determine what is of interest and relevance to them and then negotiate further reading and assessment tasks.”(Hase, S. & Kenyon, C. 2000)\nAs a learning community for faculty and staff in higher education the expectation in #DigPINS is not one of teaching novices but of learning together in community around some shared resources. Heutagogy is not the only learning theory that #DigPINS aligns with but when thinking about participation it is an interesting frame.\nReferences\nHase, S. & Kenyon, C.

We are moving right along and once again thank you to everyone for your thoughts, insights, questions and comments as we work through our topics. This week we concentrate on the one everyone has been waiting for…\nDigital Pedagogy\nIt is important to recognize that\ndigital pedagogy\nis different from\nonline learning\n. Digital pedagogy can, and often does, take place in face to face courses but of course online learning is a form of digital pedagogy.\nSome of the guiding questions for this week are:\nHow do different digital spaces shape your teaching and students’ learning?\nWhat does “the digital” give to teaching and learning and what does it take away?\nHow do we create learning communities in online spaces?\nLet’s think for a moment about the digital spaces we have been using to communicate during DigPINS. Compare the style of say Slack Vs blogging style Vs Twitter style. Slack is often shorter messages but isn’t it interesting that, unlike Twitter, it is not because of an imposed character limit. The possibility for longer messages exists in Slack and it does happen but not as often. Slack, if you are using the app and get notifications, feels faster somehow. And what about blogging? Even when they are shorter blogs somehow feel more like a “conversation by letter” – email kind of feels that way too but email is more private (or at least it seems that way – though emails are forwarded with no notification all of the time).\nThe affordances and limitations of different tools – what they allow you to do and where they put up barriers – shape the way you present yourself, communicate, interact, and even just… are. So, of course they affect the way you teach. But this should not be a surprise, even our physical classrooms affect the way we teach. Is there a chalkboard or a whiteboard, does the furniture move, what is the lighting like? Answers to these questions impact how we teach and digital environments are no different.\nActivities\nContinue to Converse through Blog Posts and Slack\nWatch our welcome for the week\nAutumm Caines\nNo subscribers\nSubscribe\nPedagogy week digpins 2020\nWatch later\nShare\nCopy link\nInfo\nShopping\nTap to unmute\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\nYou're signed out\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

Will we be online or not, will students have reliable internet or not, will our students be experienced in online learning or not…? We are going to refer to these as spectrums of critical uncertainty and this exercise will explore them and challenge us to consider possible ways to affect them.\nIf you can make it to the sync meeting let us know if you will be coming by\nfilling out this short form\nTo start this activity we are asking you to identify a spectrum of critical uncertainty for fall of 2020.\nUse this doc\nto add your name to a spectrum that has been identified already or to create one of your own.\nTo work async feel free to dive in and\nuse this slide deck\nto map two critical uncertainties\nOn Thursday – sync: those who can attend our sync session will work in groups to map the spectrums and write about overlapping scenarios. The main session and break out groups will be recorded and added to a YouTube playlist.\nReadings:\nThere is a lot of information on digital pedagogy – we are providing you this list to get started.

Our “platform” is the internet itself! There are several benefits to this including building digital fluency and resilience but also getting an opportunity to explore the affordances and limitations of a variety of tools. On this page we outline some of the tools that we are planning to use though it is not uncommon for a new tool to be included as the #DigPINS experience emerges.\nsnc.digpins.org\nYes, this very site is part of our digital tools! New information will be posted here weekly as each of our major topics are explored including readings, activities, videos, and even interactive games/content. When new info gets posted I will also make an announcement on Slack that something new is available.\nWe will also use this site as our blogging environment so those in the SNC cohort will log-in to this site to post their blog posts. See more on this below under the “Blogs” heading.\nOne note – snc.digpins.org is our “SNC#DigPINS hub” but our partner schools also have their own hub sites and while we are all generally following the same curriculum you may notice some small differences between the content on each hub site. Some of the hub sites look very similar so be sure you are at snc.digpins.org (Look for the SNC logo in the upper left) to get the info for the SNC group (though you can feel free to explore the others too).\nSlack\nSlack will be our main communication tool for #DigPINS. You will need an account you can create via an email invite you will receive during Week 0.\nSlack is a text based chat program that is a little more fun than similar technologies. Conversations are broken up by “channels” to keep things tidy but you can also private message individuals and create private groups. It has fun features like emoji reactions and gif responses. As a messaging app you are encouraged to drop in questions and comments about our shared experiences (readings, activities, videos, etc) as they come to you. You should not expect immediate responses but the chance of immediate responses does exist and in this way adds a bit of spontaneity to the group. You can respond to others in text, gif, emoji reaction and more.\nTo get started with Slack:\nClick the “Sign up for our Slack” link that you receive in the “Welcome to #DigPINS” email you receive from me during Week 0. This link will let you sign up for an account. Make sure to enter your SNC email address.\nDownload the app for your computer and / or mobile devices\n. After downloading and installing the app, you will be able to click the link above to sign in to our workspace, or you can enter the url when prompted:\ndigpins.slack.com\nI would recommend you also watch this video I made on getting started with Slack:\nTaylor Jadin\n15 subscribers\nSubscribe\nGetting started with Slack for #DigPINS\nWatch later\nShare\nCopy link\nInfo\nShopping\nTap to unmute\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\nYou're signed out\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

Still, I am planning to send calendar invites for synchronous events and those will generate an email. In addition to this if I’m having trouble reaching out to someone I may email to check-in. Finally, things do happen and no technology is foolproof so in case of Slack or any of our other systems failing I will use email as a fall back.\nBlog Posts on this site\nAs part of developing a digital identity participants are asked to write public blog posts on a weekly basis as well as reflect on others who are blogging about #DigPINS. Our SNC cohort will be blogging on this very site – snc.digpins.org. During Week 0 you will receive an email invite to claim an author account on this site. You should claim your account and access the blog prior to week 1.\nHere’s a video on blogging for #DigPINS that covers getting ideas for posts, logging in, and writing and publishing your post:\nTaylor Jadin\n15 subscribers\nSubscribe\nGetting Started with Blogging for #DigPINS\nWatch later\nShare\nCopy link\nInfo\nShopping\nTap to unmute\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\nYou're signed out\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

Our partner schools will be blogging on their own hub sites but we have set up a “discussion hub” that actually pulls all of the posts from all four partner schools into one place! We call it\ndiscuss.digpins.org\nand it also has links to each of the other schools’ hub sites. You can use discuss.digpins.org as a way to explore what those at other institutions are thinking of the readings, activities, and other parts of #DigPINS and when you post at snc.digpins.org it also automatically gets posted to discuss.digpins.org.\nTwitter\nThroughout the course participants are encouraged to join in on live Twitter chats with some established online communities, as well as the ongoing asynchronous conversation using the\nhashtag #DigPINS\n. You may want to wait to establish your twitter account till after week 1 if you are still considering aspects of “digital identity.”\nHypothes.is\nHypothes.is\nis a social annotation tool for the web and digital documents. You will need an account which you can sign up for on the Hypothesis website and a browser plugin is optional. This tool allows us to collectively mark up a text that we are all reading in-line with comments, questions, and even video and images. You will be prompted to create your account during the week that we will actually use Hypothes.is\nVideo Calls\nOver the course of #DigPINS we will have a few synchronous meetings via video call. You will need a camera and microphone to be able to participate; this could be a webcam on your computer or a smartphone/tablet. You will also need a strong internet signal to connect though many of the providers also allow for a phone call to connect – though this only allows for voice communication. Some sync video platforms are Google Meet, Zoom, Skype, and others. The platform will be announced when the call is announced.\nWeek 0 focus areas\nWeek 0 is broken up into four pages –\nOverview\n– What is this all about?\nStructure\n– What will we discuss over the course of #DigPINS? How is our time spent?\nParticipation\n– What does it mean to participate in a connected learning experience?\nDigital Tools\n– #DigPINS uses a variety of digital tools and this page has details about many of them."}

There are some amazing people doing digital scholarship on Twitter in both Classics (\nSententiae Antiquae\n) and Mesopotamian culture (\nDr. Moudhy Al-Rashid\n) among others. I thought about trying to make and maintain\nTwitter lists\n, but I’m not really a list maintainer (I mean, I can\nmake\nthem, no problem!).\nOn the personal side of my Tweets, lots of them were political, with others revolving around sports, movies, and just general goofiness. I used gocardigan to delete my tweets every three months or so. This system worked pretty well for me, for the most part.\nThat was until this past 27 May and the murder of George Floyd. As a straight, cis, white male academic with tenure, I finally brought myself to as rigorous an examination of my privilege and apathy as I’ve ever had in my life. I’ve begun the long-term work to change my habits and dispositions in a variety of ways–what I read, what I teach, how I teach, and how/what I use my social media for.\nIn the Twitterverse, that meant changing my timeline. I began to follow a number of accounts of Black authors, scholars, and activists. With but a few exception, I’ve dedicated my own timeline to issues of structural racism in America (and in the American Catholic Church), police brutality, Whiteness, and the need for just social and economic structures in my country.\nTwitter is my main news source (for better and for worse). I read, tweet, and RT quite a bit everyday. So, changing the content of what I see on Twitter is not a minor thing for me, because now I’m seeing, reading, and interacting with a lot of people and ideas that I’d otherwise would not have known.\nThe rather obvious, but really significant takeaway for me is this: I\ncame\nto Twitter seeking out people like me. Now I\nstay\non Twitter for the absolutely essential need\nto listen to people who aren’t like me\n. These first, small steps are part of a larger project of trying to be part of a network where I decenter myself.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\n3\nbloggers\nlike this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nWhere’s the Poetry?\nNext Post\nDigital Pedagogy\n(2) Comments\nHoward Ebert\nJune 18, 2020 at 3:14 pm\nReply\nTom, I love your blog.

We have activities, readings, and a video call this week. Each week we encourage you to blog about your thoughts from that week’s interactions and to engage with one another in our Slack channels.\nBefore you can interact with others in a digital space you need an identity of some kind yourself. Digital environments allow people to express and portray themselves in a myriad of ways. Sometimes digital spaces are used to paint authentic reflections of self but they can also be used to create new identities. Identities do not have to be that of an individual and often they are not.\nIf you did not get a chance to review\nweek 0 materials\nthat is okay but for this week you should be sure that at minimum you have access to Slack and this blog. More info on that is found on the\ndigital tools page of Week 0\n.\nSet goals for yourself\nHaving a clear goal is part of being successful in this kind of learning community. Yogi Berra once said, “\nyou can observe a lot just by watching\n,” but we’d argue that you’ll learn more if you set some targets for tools you’d like to try out, topics you’d like to explore, or activities you’d like to do. So we encourage you, in these early weeks, to spend some time thinking about your goals for the next month of #DigPINS. You can share those goals on your blog post, in the backchannel, or privately with the facilitator or some other cohort members. A goal could be as simple as gathering in community with others in online environments to see what that’s like.\nDigital Identity\n#DigPINS starts with an exploration / reflection on one’s own digital identity(s). Together, we will think about and discuss the digital identities that we have or would like to develop. We are not going to encourage a “right way” to form a digital identity. Rather, we will each share what spaces we occupy online and we will discuss what has worked for each person, what hasn’t, what fears we may have, and possible ideal identities for given contexts, as well as what we would like to avoid.\nSome of the guiding questions include:\nHow do you portray yourself in different online spaces?\nHow does a digital environment shape the way you can portray yourself?\nWhat social traces do you leave when you are on the web?\nHow would you like to start / continue curating or shaping your digital presence and identity?\nThis Week’s Activities, Readings, etc.\nThis week think about how you are going to get to know the others in our group. When we share physical space we don’t need to think about this as much or do as much. We send subtle cues about who we are by the way that we dress, the way we hold ourselves, the way we decorate our spaces, etc. In a digital space we have to think a little more about these things and try to send those signals in other ways. Consider updating your Slack profile with the name of your school and your role. Add a picture to your profile – not comfortable sharing a picture of your face – that is okay, choose another picture that you can identify with in some way.\nMajor Content for this Week:\nRead\nWhy Academics Need a Digital Persona\n– Laura Pasquini\nRead\nIn Praise of Living in Public\n(this article is a great introduction to the idea of context collapse) – Bonnie Stewart\nView this welcome video\nfrom the facilitators\nTaylor Jadin\n15 subscribers\nSubscribe\nWeek 1: Digital Identity - #DigPINS Summer 2020\nWatch later\nShare\nCopy link\nInfo\nShopping\nTap to unmute\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\nYou're signed out\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

You can choose how you would like to make it but I recommend that you just draw it out on paper and then take a picture of it to share it with us. You may already have more than one digital identity if you maintain an identity for a business or project – feel free to map whichever identity you feel you would like to explore. At minimum share it in our Slack #week-1-identity channel but if you are looking to share more broadly post it on Twitter using our hashtag #DigPINS.*Optional but very cool – If you are looking to go even further with exploring your digital identity some of the originators of the V&R mapping have moved away from V&R and started a new mapping process they are calling the\nDigital Practice Triangle\n. How does the triangle compare to the 2×2 matrix?\nSync Video Call\n– We have two dates\nTuesday June 2nd at 9am and Wednesday June 3rd at 11am\n– (thank you everyone who filled out the Doodle poll). To keep the calls balanced in terms of numbers we have divided the group in two. You should have a calendar invite with your call time. We will be using activities from the\nLiberating Structures\nfor these meetings.\nBlogging\n–  Write a blog post here on snc.digpins.org (by the end of the week or even into the start of next week) with the #DigPINS community as your intended audience\nWhat to write about?\nThis week’s post can be a response or reflection to the readings, the visitor / resident activity, a conversation from slack, or anything else you find related – maybe something happened in your life this week or in the news that you find is related to “digital identity”. If you are having trouble picking a topic maybe think about posting to Slack to ask for some ideas. You can reflect in many ways (writing is only one), maybe, consider a video response – there are no word limits or maximus but remember your audience probably wants something in the middle (not too long or too short). Part of “blogging” is also reading and commenting on others’ posts so don’t forget to do that and remember the posts from all of the cohorts from all five schools is at\ndiscuss.digpins.org\n. Once you create a new post don’t forget to promote your post in Slack or on Twitter – no one knows that you have posted unless you tell them.\nIntroduce yourself in Slack\n– By now you should have access to our Slack team. To get started introduce yourself with a few sentences around who you are and why you are interested in #DigPINS in the #common-room channel in Slack.\nNote that Slack will be our main mode of communication. To get the most out of this experience you should check it daily.\nIf you feel comfortable, the best way to stay in contact is to download the app and make sure the notifications are turned on.\nSome things you could/should use Slack for:\n– Posting quick informal thoughts on readings or concepts\n– Responding to others’ quick informal thoughts\n– Sharing other articles, videos, or podcasts that you come across\n– Promoting your blog post each week\n– Being notified that others have posted blog articles\n– Asking and answering questions\nTwitter\n– think about a twitter handle and\nsign up for twitter\nif you don’t already have one. Not sure what you want your twitter handle to be? Maybe bring that up for discussion in Slack. Remember that Twitter is a public forum.\nLooking for More / Stuff to bookmark for later?\nWe only have so much time and #DigPINS is designed to be a quick and low-time commitment kind of experience. Digital Identity is a huge topic and if you are looking for more information\nthis curation of articles, tools, repositories, platforms, and security and privacy resources\nby\nLee Skallerup Bessette\nfrom a recent workshop that she led at the Digital Humanities Summer Institute is a great resource."}

Saying that, I also have to say that I am both impressed by, and overwhelmed by the various resources that are available. In a way the abundance of possibilities, which is certainly a positive, strikes at one of my weaknesses. That is, I love to explore all sorts of new and exciting formats but do not spend the time to master any one of them and rather, like a bumble bee, simply move from one approach to another not utilizing any one of them. This tendency reflects my basic aversion of recognizing limits but that goes into a philosophical discussion that will have to be postponed. Remembering a bit of advice I got from a colleague at the beginning of the Covid-19 lock down, I need to focus and select a few,  new techniques and incorporate them more integrally into the approach I have developed over the past few months. Having said that, and given the recognition of a spectrum of critical uncertainties that face us this upcoming fall, I plan on structuring my courses with an eye toward overall digital pedagogy of which online learning will be a part. Utilizing key activities from “Liberating Structures,” this approach enables me to think of my classes in a way that is not too overwhelming and will provide a framework that is portable from a f2f to total on-line format.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\n2\nbloggers\nlike this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nWhy You Come, Why You Stay\n(1) Comment\nTaylor\nJune 25, 2020 at 2:27 pm\nReply\nFacilitating an engaging discussion remotely can be difficult and requires intentional design.

This problem is exaggerated online and it can lead to many problems. I rarely share articles or information online, but, I will ask people and they will look at me a bit different. They have said, “Cassie, you know that’s not real, right?” I always like to see the good in people and trust them, but online that is a real problem.\nAmy Collier’s talk about trusting people online really has made me reevaluate how I am looking at news online. One of the many tips I will use in the future is seeing if more than one source is covering a story. I also want to get in the habit of checking what site the story is on and reading the comments to see what other people feel.\nRecently, there has been a post going around Facebook and Twitter about the freezing temperatures and the homeless in Chicago. The post claims that at least 15 people have died in the cold on Chicago streets, and features a picture of a person seeming to be freezing on the side of the street. I believed right away, as I usually do, but this time I thought about it for a minute. I had never seen this story anywhere else, and I felt like it would have been broadcasted more. I Googled the story and did not see any other results and was very skeptical and later found out it was fake.\nTaking a second to think about if an article could be fake and not always trusting everything is a something I am trying to learn. Going forward, I hope that I think before I become angry or before I share and make not trust everything I see online.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nDigital Pedagogy\nNext Post\nMy Journey with #digPINS\n(2) Comments\nCristina Ortiz\nFebruary 1, 2019 at 2:06 am\nReply\nFake news!!!!

There are some amazing people doing digital scholarship on Twitter in both Classics (\nSententiae Antiquae\n) and Mesopotamian culture (\nDr. Moudhy Al-Rashid\n) among others. I thought about trying to make and maintain\nTwitter lists\n, but I’m not really a list maintainer (I mean, I can\nmake\nthem, no problem!).\nOn the personal side of my Tweets, lots of them were political, with others revolving around sports, movies, and just general goofiness. I used gocardigan to delete my tweets every three months or so. This system worked pretty well for me, for the most part.\nThat was until this past 27 May and the murder of George Floyd. As a straight, cis, white male academic with tenure, I finally brought myself to as rigorous an examination of my privilege and apathy as I’ve ever had in my life. I’ve begun the long-term work to change my habits and dispositions in a variety of ways–what I read, what I teach, how I teach, and how/what I use my social media for.\nIn the Twitterverse, that meant changing my timeline. I began to follow a number of accounts of Black authors, scholars, and activists. With but a few exception, I’ve dedicated my own timeline to issues of structural racism in America (and in the American Catholic Church), police brutality, Whiteness, and the need for just social and economic structures in my country.\nTwitter is my main news source (for better and for worse). I read, tweet, and RT quite a bit everyday. So, changing the content of what I see on Twitter is not a minor thing for me, because now I’m seeing, reading, and interacting with a lot of people and ideas that I’d otherwise would not have known.\nThe rather obvious, but really significant takeaway for me is this: I\ncame\nto Twitter seeking out people like me. Now I\nstay\non Twitter for the absolutely essential need\nto listen to people who aren’t like me\n. These first, small steps are part of a larger project of trying to be part of a network where I decenter myself.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\n3\nbloggers\nlike this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nWhere’s the Poetry?\nNext Post\nDigital Pedagogy\n(2) Comments\nHoward Ebert\nJune 18, 2020 at 3:14 pm\nReply\nTom, I love your blog.

The only “teaching” I do consists of me trying to reexplain items that friends and classmates don’t understand from their classes.\nThe core subject I consider myself the best at is math, but ask anyone close to me and they will tell you I am a horrible math tutor or teacher. This is because my brain works and understands a little bit differently than most other people. I understand math easily, meaning I am one of the worst people to try to teach math because I can’t explain how I understand it, I just do.\nThe other area I “teach” the most would be website design. One of the main reasons I am horrible at teaching is I am horrible at explaining why I just understand how. I also tend to take over and try to do everything myself. I very much like having control, and instead of explaining the problem, I just take over and fix it myself.\nI always claim I never want to be a teacher, but learning different ways to teach technology to others was definitely beneficial for me.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nMy Digital Project Disaster\nNext Post\nReflections on Digital Pedagogy and Digital Spaces\n(2) Comments\nReid\nJanuary 26, 2019 at 3:43 pm\nReply\nBy creating websites you are building learning environments.   Think about it as creating spaces for others to learn.   This is why instructional designers need to know a lot about learning and motivation.   If you design an engaging site that “pulls in” users, then you are doing the same thing a teacher does, facilitating learning.\nautumm\nJanuary 26, 2019 at 9:29 pm\nThis is an interesting juxtaposition that Reid brings up here. Inside of an educational institution we often call what he is describing “Instructional Design”. But work that is very similar happens outside of educational institutions and goes by the name “UX designer” or the like.\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

It put me in my current mood (see otter for reference) which has lingered in decreasing intensity throughout the week. I’m glad writing it was therapeutic for you, Anne Helen Petersen, but I could’ve done without the reminder that despite how hard I work I will most likely never be as financially successful as many before me.\nThe article did spark thoughts on how our burnout, fueled by many things including financial instability, affects our work as professionals in higher education. Are we more empathetic to our students’ struggles? Or are we less tuned in? Are we more versatile, willing to experiment with new methods of teaching? Etc. Building off these questions, I spent some time contemplating how our perspectives/intersecting identities affect the way we approach teaching and learning digitally.\nDigital Teaching & Learning\nI currently only teach one course called Gateway, it is in the same spirit as a freshman seminar course. I primarily used Google classroom to communicate with my students outside of our meeting times. In hindsight, I wish I had done a brief survey on how helpful the students found Google classroom. I put up general reminders (add/drop dates, withdraw deadline, etc.) as well as information specific to our class (room change, remember tech, etc.). My student mentor also started a group chat using Whatsapp.\nThis was my first year really utilizing Google classroom and Whatsapp to interact and communicate with students. There seemed to be a lot less confusion and miscommunication than previous years when I relied on email alone.\nI am not sure if I will use any other tools or digital venues next year but this week has opened by eyes to the sheer plethora of options and capacity for creativity. Prior to my experiences in #DigPINS, I did perceived online learning to be rigid and dull.

The students always enjoyed doing them and I enjoyed seeing how creative they were. One year, I had a group of talented students that were also fairly tech savvy and had access to video editing tools. After finishing their video project, this particular group decided to market their video around the school, invite other students to the “premiere” (which took place in my classroom), and then uploaded their production to YouTube so that it could be widely shared and watched by as many people as they could get it out to. They were a hit. Their Spanish video was the talk of the school for a couple of weeks. So, I guess that one could say that my first brush with digital spaces and course content was completely accidental. I was led there by a group of forward-thinking and extremely creative students, who introduced me to its potential.\nLater, I would use this experience to develop a final project in a Humanities course at the university level in which students created videos similar to those on the History Channel to analyze Hispanic myths and legends. Students uploaded their videos to YouTube at the end of the semester and commented on each other’s work. However, in this class there were several students that were uncomfortable with sharing their work publicly and they were concerned about what would come up online when someone searched their name. We worked out a compromise involving screen names and a limited time frame, after which they were free to remove the videos.\nIn my time at St. Norbert College, I have done online discussion boards in one of my larger classes. On these boards, I post 3 or 4 reflection questions regarding the assignment. Students record a video response to these questions, which is then uploaded to the website that allows them to watch and comment on the videos of others. I then reference these video responses in class to further our discussions.\nThese past couple of weeks have opened my eyes to the many tools that are out there for digital learning. I feel like I have barely dipped my toes in the water, but I am looking forward to trying some of the new things that I have learned in DigPINS. I am already thinking of ways that I could incorporate Hypothes.is in my advanced courses and I plan on looking into the resources that Dr. Mia Zamora mentioned in the video call today. I’m excited to see what other new ideas and tools are out there!\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nA Different Mindset\nNext Post\nDigital Pedagogy\n(4) Comments\nReid\nJanuary 26, 2019 at 3:32 pm\nReply\nWas your discovery “accidental”?   That is not the term I would use.  You created a context that was so engaged the students took the learning beyond your expectations..   That is simply good teaching.   Project-based learning gives students ownership of their learning and the opportunity to be creative.   It requies students to use their critical thinking skills to organize and synthesize information.  The technology is simply a mechanism that allows them to express their learning effectively.\nKatie G\nFebruary 2, 2019 at 3:41 pm\nThank you, Reid. I could not agree more with your comments about giving students opportunities to take ownership of their learning and be creative. I think it is important to give students the space to explore and take risks, so that they can apply what they have learned and then take that information to the next level.\nCristina Ortiz\nFebruary 1, 2019 at 2:12 am\nReply\nThese are such interesting activities!

I have never met anyone exclusively online, but it has been an incredible way to connect to old friends that I can’t see every day. One downside of social media is how lonely it can make a person feel. One article I read, “Have Smartphones Destroyed a Generation” by Jean Twenge mentioned how generations are becoming more and more lonely because of the connection on social media. At first, I did not understand what it meant but each day it makes more and more sense. As I mentioned a little bit last week, I post very differently based on who my audience is and what social media I am posting on. Facebook is mainly for family, Instagram is mainly for friends, and Snapchat is mainly to connect to friends and classmates.\nThe other problem on social media that has been bothering me a bit lately has been the inability to forget. So many celebrities have had their careers ruined because of tweets or posts from countless years ago. I recently went through all of my social media accounts and made sure that I deleted everything from my cringy middle school years. I am pretty careful at what I post because I am terrified of something I post ruining my career later in life.\nThe article “How Millennials Became The Burnout Generation” by Anne Helen Petersen really helped me to evaluate my life and open my eyes to some of the things I thought were normal. I am not a millennial, but I do understand most of the struggles of the millennial generation. I am constantly making lists and I feel unaccomplished when I can’t complete them. I heard recently that no list should be longer than seven items, and I am hoping to start following that. I also need to allow myself to have more downtime in my life and have time to shut my brain off and sit in silence. Sometimes when I do take “mental health days” I feel like it is a waste of a day and I have even more to do in even less time. I really do not like silence and always have noise around me, but I really do need to take time to shut all the electronics off around me.\nAnother problem that is very different for my parents than me is the necessity of college. When my mom went to college it was a privilege because she wanted to earn a better job. Basically, all of the jobs now require a college education and a Bachelor’s degree as a minimum. I am not really interested in going on to get a Master’s degree or a Doctorate. I really hope that a Bachelor’s degree is enough for me to get a good job after graduation.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\ndigital_id19 C-C\nNext Post\nContagions in Twitter vs. Blogs vs. Podcasting\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

A few years ago, one of my colleagues presented an amazing assignment she created on Google+ and how she had her students create posts instead of traditional papers. Sounds easy enough, right???\nI attempted to recreate this assignment and failed, miserably. For my privilege class, I has students post for different topics over the course of the semester, all 15 weeks. I gave them about 12 topics, let them choose 8 topics to post about, and let them run free. What this turned into was a grading nightmare, tons and tons of email notifications, and me still receiving emails from these students about posts that have nothing to do with this class.\nI guess I can say I leaped before testing the waters. I’m in a weird generation (read, anti-millennial!!!) where I grew up without technology but began relying on it heavily in college. BUT, I am not up to speed. While Google+ seemed easy enough to tackle, I didn’t seek out help. I should have met with IT and really thought this process through.\nMoving forward, I have taken what I have learned so far from the DIGPINS experience and am once again making an attempt to incorporate digital projects into my classes. Thanks to Autumn, I am connected to IT and will be getting their help with this process and not doing this solo. While I am still traumatized by my first experience, I’m confident that Taylor will teach me what I need to know and this second go-round will be a success!!\nHere’s hoping!!!\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nSalty with a Side of Contemplation\nNext Post\nA Different Mindset\n(3) Comments\nTaylor Jadin\nJanuary 25, 2019 at 9:58 pm\nReply\nExcited to see what you can come up with for your next project and I’ll be excited to help out.

It was, truly, not worth the paper it was written on, but today’s assignment reminded me of the piece.\nIn my short story, I found it excruciatingly entertaining that there might be a young man whose bushy eyebrows merged above his nose, creating one single, overly hairy facial feature.  In hindsight, I’m not totally sure what I was thinking, or why I found that even interesting.  And that’s not the connection I made here, thankfully.\nNo, what captured me was the “uni” part.  In the context of our assignment, it occurs to me that my use of digital media is very, very unidirectional (ah, see, FINALLY he gets there!), almost always me sending information forward, not being sure (a) that anyone will care to read it or interact with it and (b) that I especially care if they care.\nWho do you interact with online?\n“Interact with” would be a stretch, I think, and this is not being falsely humble. As I’ve shared, while I dabble a bit in many platforms, and have accounts in most of the ones we’ve discussed here, when I think to use them, I imagine it sort of like a commercial airing now for a beer company.  In the commercial, a group of medieval archers have been given the task of making the village aware that the beer is now listing its ingredients.  Their method of doing so — their social media — is to affix the nutritional labels to arrows, and then shoot them randomly and wantonly from the castle’s turrets, hoping someone, somewhere will notice.  THAT is how I see my online interactions, for the most part: I randomly fire off pretty pictures, interesting thoughts, veiled insults, or meaningful (to me) messages, and hope for the best.\nA relatively small circle of family and friends will interact at the level of “liking” things, and every now and then a snarky comment from me will elicit a snarky comment from someone else, but in general I’ve been neither strategic nor especially intentional.\nHow do you find and join networks?\nHonestly, this happens most often when I’m led there by something I’ve stumbled across on Newsweek, HuffPost. NYTimes, Washington Post … or Cracked.com.  Again, not very intentional and certainly not strategic.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nUncharted Territory\nNext Post\ndigital_id19 C-C\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\nWrite a Comment...\nEmail (Required)\nName (Required)\nWebsite\nLoading Comments...\nComment\n×\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

The stuff Case talks about in\nThe Wisdom and Madness of Crowds\nis not specific to any particular online or offline or type of media, so I’m going to apply this type of thinking to Twitter, blogging, and podcasting and see if I can come up with any interest comparisons or contrasts.\nTwitter\nAs Case points out, a large network with tons of connections between all of its members can lead to group think, which can make it difficult for complex, new, or challening ideas to gain traction. Platforms like Twitter can exacerbate this problem, with its 280 character limit. In addition to this retweeting makes it easy to copy and paste an idea on a large scale. This means that some things can get taken out of context and short and simple ideas can go viral easily.\nBlogging\nMost blogs sites would look very different as a network than a network on Twitter. Blog sites typically have less authors than readers\n[1]\nso these networks so I’ll call these one-to-many networks:\nExcuse my scribbles.\nThis is very different from the the networks we usually see in Case’s examples:\nAgain, excuse my scribbes. The drawings in The Wisdom and Madness of Crowds are way better.\nYou might say that one-to-many networks aren’t really networks at all, and are closer to a form of broadcast communication. That aside, it’s at least still useful for me to compare the two using Case’s language around networks and crowds, so I’m going to keep rolling with this one-to-many networks thing.\n[2]\nBlog sites do often have a comment section, where many people can participate, but these sections usually aren’t featured as prominently on the page, so they really feel more like a sub-network than a network to me.\nIn contrast to Twitter, blogs also have all the space the author needs to get a complicated idea across. The only real limitation here is how long you can hold an audiences attention.\nPodcasts\nPodcasts as a network have very similar one-to-many structure to blogs. Typically a successful podcast has a few hosts a large amount of listeners. Podcasts cannot offer comments sections like blogs do, although many podcast hosts welcome audience feedback and follow-up and will incorporate that into the show. What makes that different from blogs though is that that audience feedback is usually behind by one episode\n[3]\n, as the audience won’t have anything to react to until after the podcast episode has been published. Therefore feedback usually for a given episode of a podcast will, at the earliest, show up in time to record the next episode.\nPodcasts offer plenty of time for the creator to communicate a complex idea, as its not uncommon to see a runtime of 1 – 2 hours. On top of this, because podcasts usually have more than one host, the audience gets to here two or more people have a discussion about an idea, which can make it easier for the listener to relate to the discussion and feel like they’re a part of the conversation (even though they aren’t). Most of my favorite podcasts have a format that can essentially be summed up as “Three friends talk about a topic they all have in common.” For me this means that when I hear one of my favorite podcast hosts recommend something, it feels more like I’m a part of their network, and so that recommendation is more valuable to me.\nSuccessful ones do anyway. For my purposes I am going to say that in order for a blog to be a network, it neads to have some kind of audience.\n↩︎\nDon’t stop me now.\n↩︎\nUnless the podcast is broadcasted live while they record. Some hosts will choose to do this and offer a\nlive chat room.\n↩︎\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nRelating to the millennial Generation\nNext Post\nSalty with a Side of Contemplation\n(1) Comment\nReid\nJanuary 20, 2019 at 2:58 pm\nReply\nInteresting.\nAs humans, we are social beings, we naturally create networks.  Networks provide a support system that helps us flourish.\nHistorically our networks were contracted around the immediate physical environment.  Digital tools can allow us to expand our networks beyond the geographic location.   What we seem to be discussing is the fact that these networks do not have the same characteristics as our immediate social network structures.  Taylor is highlighting how the medium impacts the nature of the network.  If we consider our visitor/resident maps, we begin to see that we likely have sets of interconnected and overlapping networks.   Thus, there is a complexity in our lives that pevious generations have not experienced.  We are grappling with what that means for our personal and professional lives as the technology continues to evolve and expand.\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

I created an avatar and entered a sandbox/tutorial just to mess around. Half way through choosing my clothes, I got bored, figured I had the general idea and jumped worlds. All of a sudden, I could hear real people talking about me. “What is she doing? What happened to her clothes?” I realized that I was expected to follow the IRL social norms. When I tried to talk to people and ask questions about where I was and what I should do, the avatars around me slunk away. One girl offered to help, but when she got bored after a few minutes, she hopped worlds and I was left on my own. Pretty sad state of affairs when you get dissed by cartoon characters. Also, startling to realize that there were people so vested in their online identity that they couldn’t be seen virtually hanging out with an ignorant, half-dressed, androgynous computer generated pixel-creature. I have learned to be more mindful of the sensibilities of the real people behind the online personas.\nProfessionally, I have been obligated a few times to create an online identity. I keep it as objective and minimal as possible for a variety of security and privacy reasons.\nKatie G\naddressed one of my major concerns in her Jan 9 2019 9:09 pm blog post:\nAt the MLA, in fact, some scholars stressed discretion in tweeting about unpublished research presented by junior faculty members, contingent faculty/staff, and students. It wasn’t that those at the conference were resisting this digital platform, it was that they were conscious of the vulnerability of those with less power and/or experience, and who are at more risk of getting their ideas scooped.\nThere are institutions and individuals who have a finders-keepers mentality online with little respect for copyright or attribution. Content creators who share freely find their work being monetized by mills, or see their work misrepresented, taken out of context, and their professional reputations compromised.\nMore than anything else, I perceive my online identity as a consumer and observer, not a creator of content. I would like to feel comfortable having a public identity. Who am I online? A lurker.\nWhat social traces do you leave?\nVery little:) When you search for me, you will find a list of places where I have lived and one where my identity was stolen. There is also a random set of relatives, my age, and my current address.  Many marketers seem to know some very intimate details of my financial status-not sure who’s selling it to them, but it’s pretty accurate. I have dabbled with a lot of sites (created a Moodle, student taught online for UW-Stevens Point, a deleted Facebook and Google Plus account, etc.) There are a couple of news articles I appear in.

In particular, his point that “we struggle to know what good teaching and learning looks like in online classes” really resonated with me.  As a trumpet teacher, I cannot expect my students to play with a beautiful sound if they have never head a beautiful trumpet sound before.  As a novice to online teaching and learning experiences, I am seeing for the first time the possibilities of what this can look like, especially when thoughtfully presented as is the case with DigPINS.  I am hearing the music for the first time, so to speak.\nIn this spirit of “small” and  making progress incrementally, I am writing this post.  I have been contemplating the readings and your posts in previous weeks, but have been reluctant to join the conversation.  Part of this is my own inexperience in the digital environment.  However, it makes me wonder about one of Lederman’s assertions that “every student has a voice online”.  As a student, I was always eager to discuss and ask questions in a traditional classroom setting.  But, I am finding I have allowed myself essentially no voice in the written conversation over the last few weeks.  In the same way that we all have certain ways of reaching students who are reluctant participators in a traditional classroom, how can we help students who are reluctant participators in the digital environment?\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nNetworking Week\nNext Post\nDigital pedagogical communities\n(3) Comments\nMiles\nJuly 15, 2019 at 6:02 pm\nReply\nTo me, this relates back to Week 1 and the whole digital identity issue. After more reflection, I’ve found that I keep my identities very separate where any cross-over feels almost uncomfortable or foreign. I wonder if students have traditional classroom identities as well as digital classroom identities, and if they feel uncomfortable using their new identity as well. I also wonder what we as instructors can do to foster a digital classroom identity in our students (some students may have never developed these before as it’s likely different from a digital personal identity).\nReid Riggle\nJuly 15, 2019 at 7:03 pm\nReply\nA very good question.  I don’t have the answer, but I simply try to apply the same principles I would in a face-to-face context.  “Meet students where they are.”  By that I mean learn about them and connect on some individual level.  Teaching is about relationships.  Of course that may mean you need to reveal something of yourself in the process.\nDamien MIchaud\nJuly 16, 2019 at 1:51 pm\nReply\nI find it interesting how online learning can privilege certain participants–and in my experience–it is often those most reluctant to speak up when face to face. I think it might have something to do with a different conception of time. For those learners that are either naturally introverted, or those that take some time to process information, an online discussion can allow them to shine. Whereas in the real time mix of the traditional classroom, they may be less able to jump in.\nYour case is the opposite at this point, but I think that time and experience will lead you to more comfort with the affordances of online interaction.\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

And, we might well ask, where else are our names written in this digital age?\nFacebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn? Oh, you don’t do social media! Do you search on google, do you use email, you have and/or read blogs, have you bought anything on line with Amazon prime, Amazon Smile, do you keep abreast of the Daylesford Abbey website, the NYTimes Cooking blog ? If so, your name is written everywhere forever.\nWe all have digital identities. Indeed, we have many. One person’s Buttigieg tweets might well give others a different idea of her than her Richard Rohr daily meditation site or her google searches.\nAnd it’s true for God too. Unfortunately for God, the Creator, Rescuer and Covenant identities got lost in the Satan-inspired and fake judge – blame – condemn website that took over the religious culture of Jesus’ time and is still, sadly, operative among Christians of all varieties.\nIf you get the picture I’m trying to paint then you can understand better why in today’s gospel Jesus has a vision of Satan falling like lightning from the sky. In terms of this homily, Jesus has hacked the hacker and disconnected his Wi-Fi. The seventy disciples sent by Jesus went to heal and bring the peace of God in the face of the sick, diseased and deeply anxious women and men beset with the Satan-the-hacker’s idea that their suffering was a sign of their disconnect from God, that God was punishing them for some wrong doing conscious or unconscious.\nThe disciples’ message of peace and healing without cost released people – and us – from ever thinking that earthquakes, the death of children, the onset of cancer or any other affliction is caused by God, much less be a punishment for sin. That’s the Hacker’s judge / blame / condemn fake news image of God.\nBut, from the beginning and for centuries, God was self-identifying as loving Creator and Rescuer, Protector and, in today’s reading from Isaiah, nurturing Mother. This prophetic image came in a time when God’s People were becoming discouraged and giving up on the rebuilding of Jerusalem after seventy years of exile. But we’re all rebuilding: the world, the nation, our university/college, our family, ourselves.\nThe prophet was calling them and now us to get to know and believe and act out of God’s authentic identity. The paradox is that God can’t be known and authentically identified except through God’s creatures — how we act from what we say we believe. This is why God’s clearest identity is seen in Jesus Christ who sends us to be disciples of peace and healing.\nSo, to return to the beginning and to stretch a point, just as our budgets reveal our values, so our daily words and deeds and even our digital identities (if fully known, God forbid!) speak to us and to others about the identity of God.\nBeware of hackers, beware of the big hacker falling like lightning from the sky!\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nPersonal Librarian Network\nNext Post\nConfronting the Dragon\n(2) Comments\nReid Riggle\nJuly 7, 2019 at 5:34 pm\nReply\nFantastic!

I joined Facebook in 2007 and started a Twitter account in 2010, in the middle of my graduate program in library and information science. I joined Facebook to creep on people I met in college. I joined Twitter to connect with other librarians and info science people as I prepared to enter the job market. My professors, my mentors, and my classmates spent a lot of time way back then debating what our online presence should be and what our role was as librarians both to contribute to a learning network as well as what it took to be curators of online networks. It’s interesting reflecting on these early days of the social Internet in today’s current times and seeing how the tension has evolved.\nI created a separate Twitter account to participate in #DigPINS, and so have been replicating my PLN to some extent, with a bit more attention to building a more professional network. My process is the same as when I built my first Twitter PLN though: to search #hashtags that will lead me to conversations I want to potentially be a part of, like #critlib (critical librarianship). I got into the habit in graduate school of looking up authors of articles I liked on the Twitters, and then following them to connect to their networks. I also look to see if they have blogs I can bookmark and will occasionally give them shout-outs on Twitter to let them know I admire their work and/or at least am reading their blog. At conferences, I will often look folks up on Twitter using conference hashtags and start following them to stay connected or to start a connection after the conference. I’m spending a lot of time scrolling through Twitter accounts of professionals I admire to see who they retweet and mention to find additional folks. I feel lucky that librarians and information science professionals normalized networking via social media way back when.\nI was waiting to see if Seaman would mention echo chambers in\nPersonal Learning Networks: Knowledge Sharing as Democracy\n, which she finally did, “It’s also important to include a range of voices in a PLN. Incorporating individuals with\ndiverse opinions\navoids the risk of the network becoming an ‘\necho chamber\n’, where dominant opinions are ‘echoed’ back to network members. This can obscure alternate viewpoints and\nprevent learning\nfrom taking place.”\nI was a bit put off by this article because I feel it simplifies 1) the work of Sherry Turkle and 2) echo chambers.\nAs we know, it’s much easier said than done to avoid an echo chamber in developing our PLNs, especially given the algorithms of today’s social media platforms. I’m going to keep thinking about this because I have a lot of thoughts still forming.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\n2\nbloggers\nlike this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\ngetting some ideas\nNext Post\nApplying Week Two\n(3) Comments\nAutumm Caines\nJuly 3, 2019 at 4:26 pm\nReply\nAlaina – I’m curious if you have ever used Tweetdeck and “Twitter lists” to help combat the echo chamber? I like them because I can “list” someone without having to “follow” them. I think part of the problem is that a follow feels so personal and other people can see who I follow. If I want to add people who I strongly disagree with to my timeline and I follow them that says something to that person and something to others who look at my followers page – and that is often not a signal I want to send. With a list I can still create a timeline of people (accounts) but I don’t have to follow them and with Tweetdeck I can put those lists right next to each other to juxtapose differing views without the signal that I agree with, accept, or want to promote those views.\nReid\nJuly 3, 2019 at 8:49 pm\nReply\nI appreciate the conversation about the risks of the echo chamber and look forward to hearing more about how we minimize this challenge.\nShan\nJuly 10, 2019 at 2:18 pm\nReply\n“As we know, it’s much easier said than done to avoid an echo chamber in developing our PLNs, especially given the algorithms of today’s social media platforms.” This is such an important thing you bring up–thanks for drawing attention to it.\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

After reading through Seaman’s article, and reading all about how she was able to join these sub-communities and build strong connections with people she never intended on meeting, I was brought back to the early 2010’s when I joined my own online community, the Xbox Live community. Sure I would join random games and play with random people, but I made some friends along the way. For a number of years, I would play with the same group of people, whom I considered to be friends of mine, and I had no idea who they really were. And even though we lacked that actual human connection between each other, we all felt as if we were our own little community. We would all log on at the same time, join a voice-chat party, and play games until the sun came up. As we got older, we all didn’t have as much time and eventually stopped playing together; and even though I never really knew them personally, it still felt like I was turning the page on such a large chapter of my life because of how close I felt to this group of guys. To this day, I still think about some of them and wonder where their life took them after we had played our last game together.\nI’m sure some people (mostly older generations) would be hesitant to call that a “friend group” because we only knew each other by screen names and never even got past where we were from. But I, and I know more people from my generation and younger would back me up on this, wouldn’t doubt for a second that we were all friends. I even see the same thing happening with my younger brothers. I’ve seen them join a random game with a random person and I’ll watch them a couple days later and they’ll still be playing with that same random person. It’s just something about the video game (and others) community that can form such strong bonds between people without either of them having to leave the comfort of their own home.\nAside from the Personal Anecdote\nOne thing I really liked from this week was the Wisdom and/or Madness of Crowds interactive game. Seeing how thoughts and behaviors can spread rapidly reminded me of\nthis video\nfrom CGP Grey which talk about basically the same thing, just not interactive. I would also suggest checking out some of his other videos, they have nothing to do with DigPINS, but I find them very interesting, specifically\nthis one\nabout the future of automation in our world. Again, it doesn’t really relate to DigPINS, but as a Computer Science major, this really peaks my interest.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\n5\nbloggers\nlike this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nConfronting the Dragon\nNext Post\nNetworking Week\n(3) Comments\nJoyce\nJuly 10, 2019 at 1:58 am\nReply\nNate,\nSeamon’s article was full of such common sense ideas about creating community on the web.  Her examples of being part of groups seemed innocent and profound and speaks to how we build community:  with the right intentions, with goals that connect to others, without early skepticism.  What impressed me most, perhaps because I am still learning to be comfortable in digital spaces, was her observation about what leads to isolation on the web:  lack of technical skills, and a lack of (fundamental–my addition) understanding of the social elements of the web!  Resonated so well with me.  Many of us just do not take the time to become skillful and fully investigate how the spaces function; then we just become fearful.  I am in the course to improve my skills and understanding of digital spaces so I can be better model for my students and be resourceful to them.  Plus I want to find other folks to learn from, and make contributions of my own.  Her ideas (and those of others) for starting to build a PLN using twitter were right on target for me!\nIn Dave Cormier’s article I wondered what kind of relationship the mother had with her child that prevented her from striking up a conversation about what he was doing on the web.  Some frame for discussions with your child could begin with how the family approaches new ventures; discuss family principles, family fun; what we do together and what we do on our own.   Parents can take leadership based on how well they know their children.  Oh goodness!  Another investment of time!  More later.

I think its interesting to think about that networks built around gaming really got popular and mainstream in probably the last 10 – 15 years, but that’s also around the time-frame that I feel like gaming got legitimized as a hobby or video games recognized as an art form and not just as toys for children.  The rise of online multiplayer gaming and the networking aspect of it probably had a lot do making it a part of the zeitgeist.\nReid\nJuly 11, 2019 at 2:26 pm\nReply\nNate- If we assume that a portion of our students had the same or similar experiences to what you described, what knowledge, skills, preferences do you think these individual bring with them to college?

So much of our academic experience is constrained by the need for courses to begin one day and end on another. Thinking explicitly about the areas of overlap (and difference) between a PLN and a course seems fruitful.\nI’ve just finished an online experience which ended with the question “is there something more we can do together to keep this going?” Unfortunately, my schedule didn’t allow me to fully engage with that effort, but your prompt does encourage me to at least check in and see if there’s any way I can still be useful to that potential PLN.\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

I may have been new to the Faculty Development Committee and our discussion was usually about the risk/reward of implementing new pedagogies. Something along the lines of:\n“I would love to be more innovative in my class, but I am afraid of any negative teacher evaluations that will hamper my prospects for tenure/promotion.” Or…\n“This all sounds interesting, but between teaching and my research I don’t have any time to try something new.”\nNow that I have passed some of those early professional hurdles, and see how quickly technology improves, AND see how my own kids interact with technology at school and at home, it is becoming very clear to me that incorporating digital learning technologies and learning spaces is no longer new or novel, but instead will be considered essential moving forward. I’m not willing to push traditional teaching out on the ice flow, but all this will likely be second nature to the next generation of educators. Do any of you feel the same? Now I am thinking about how to proceed – slowly and meticulously, straight ahead “bull-in-a-china-shop” style, something in between…\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nDigital pedagogical communities\nNext Post\nWeek 4!

I believe we need a broad conversation on campus calling out the value of innovation for elevating student learning.  We need to craft a system that not only allows for trying new strategies, but gives the faculty member willing to take the chance “credit” if they are able to explain why, what happened, and what they will do next.  In other words, we can create an environment that is conducive to taking, throughtfull, calculated, risks.     The student’s will be the benefit and the institution will thrive.\nPeace,\nReid\nMiles\nJuly 19, 2019 at 2:40 pm\n“We need to craft a system that not only allows for trying new strategies, but gives the faculty member willing to take the chance ‘credit’ if they are able to explain why, what happened, and what they will do next.”\nI love this and totally agree. I was at an institution earlier this summer where everyone, even pre-tenure folks, are actually required to be innovative in the classroom. They are able to do this because of the culture they built and of the safeguards that were put in place to protect from failure. Failure is inevitable, especially when trying new things, and I think that as an institution, we need to accept that and set policies in place to allow for that.\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

Although there are clearly through lines through identities, to a certain extent these identities differ in terms of affect, behaviors, and cognitions. That is, I may think and act very differently in the same situation, depending on what identity is active at the time. The common example I like to give in class is that you probably act differently in front of your grandma than you would at a party with friends. I know I would!\nWhat this week really showed me was that this extends quite well into the digital world. Not necessarily that we have a digital identity (i.e., a set of feelings, thoughts, and behaviors that only relate to our online selves), but that our digital behaviors are reflective of the identity that’s active at a certain time. After starting my digital identity analysis, I quickly realized that my I behave very differently online depending on whether my professional self or my personal self is active at the time. I tend to behave a lot more like a resident when my professional identity is active and a lot more of a visitor when my personal identity is active.\nI’ll be curious to see how my professional and personal social identities change over the course of this program (and my career). I would like to be more residential in my use of technology in the classroom (or more creation and conversation in the triangle model), and I hope this class will help me accomplish that. I also hope that I can facilitate students being more residential in their use of technology in their professional identities.

The need for networking is fairly intuitive – humans are social animals and having a good social network can make things easier. However, many people (not just students) find it difficult and anxiety-provoking to even think about the idea of having to network. What really stuck out to me was the contradiction of everyone knowing how important networking is, but that not many people are actually networking. I wonder if being more active (i.e., more of a resident) in the digital world can help with this problem. It’s much easier (and maybe less anxiety-provoking) to reach out to people digitally than IRL. It is for me, at least. What do you all think?\nOne takeaway from Babson was that entrepreneurs basically just have to go out and ask people for help, and the most successful people are the ones who ask the right question to the right people at the right time. After all, what’s the worst thing that can happen? They could say no? Oh well! So I want to end this post with a challenge for you all – reach out to someone who might be able to help accomplish some goal (any goal!) but you normally wouldn’t reach out to for one reason or another. I’m going to email a former classmate from grad school to see if he wants to work on a paper together.

The instrument I play, the bass trombone, rarely gets the spotlight. The best gig I ever had was as a member of the Arizona Opera Orchestra and I loved it in no small part because I could do my job in the orchestra pit while all the action was on the stage above me. I often compare playing the bass trombone to being an offensive lineman in football…if I’m doing my job correctly you won’t really notice. If I screw up (i.e. allow a career ending sack of the star quarterback) then you’ll know I’m there and I may have ruined your fantasy football season.\nI have a public face…Director of the Music Department, Director of the SNC Jazz Ensemble, instructor of a few relatively popular music-themed Core Curriculum courses…but I am not terribly comfortable trumpeting my professional accomplishments out into the world.\nAnd unfortunately, in my line of work I need to “sell” myself (and my work) more than I am confortable with. I need to sell myself to the members of the personnel committee for promotion. Sell myself to my colleagues in Faculty Development when I apply for funding to travel and perform. Sell myself to peers at other institutions to see if they are interested in having me share my work with their students. I would much rather be the type of musician that consistently plays at a high level and goes about her/his business without interruption.\nSo I am approaching the DigPins project with some enthusiasm, hoping it will:\nTeach me some skills for easily managing my professional online identity, and\nMotivate me to begin a few of the ideas I have been carrying with me for some time, waiting for the right opportunity.\nThank you for reading about my own little neurosis.

I’ve been trying to figure out how to address this more directly in #DigPINS but just so you know you are not alone. I feel it too and I’ve seen so many struggle with it. The problem is that you can’t just ignore it.\nAnother side of this that I struggle with is amplification of others. I know that people are on the web for lots of different reasons but I never like to assume that someone is on because they want to be. I know sometimes people have to be on for work or for school. I sometimes find posts that I would love to tweet out or otherwise amplify but I always hesitate if the author is not amplifying themselves. Maybe I’m overthinking it but I always wonder if they would appreciate the amplification but are just afraid of self-promoting themselves.

{"id":"e30e83f3-04af-42b0-a1a1-04273f8cd5f0","url":"https://snc.digpins.org/using-google-tools-to-promote-academic-integrity-and-knowledge-of-social-science/","title":"Using Google Tools to Promote Academic Integrity and Knowledge of Social Science – SNC #DigPINS","text":"Home\n>\nBlog\n>\nImplementation Report\n>\nUsing Google Tools to Promote Academic Integrity and Knowledge of Social Science\nThe Project\nCOME 352: Media Effects is a course focused on the field of media psychology. Within the course, students learn about social scientific research, which also addresses core curriculum goals. One of the key formative assessments in the course is a series of reading guides that teach students about the topic of the week and how to understand empirical articles.\nThe way I conducted these assignments in previous semesters was by giving students a Word document, which they downloaded, filled out, and then uploaded to Moodle. After the assignment was turned in, I graded them in Moodle and we discussed the answers in class.\nThere were a few issues that I aimed to solve by redesigning the assignment. Some students inappropriately collaborated or copied from former students. Other students copied and pasted directly from the article rather than putting things in their own words (despite instructions to the contrary). Not only do these instances violate standards of academic integrity, but they undercut student learning. In addition, I suspected that I could enhance student learning by providing a more guided experience, especially early in the semester.\nWith these goals in mind, I looked for solutions across a variety of platforms, focusing on those that would easily integrate with Moodle. Ultimately, I hit upon two formats that I implemented during the semester, Google Forms and Google Assignments. Below is a summary of how each of these worked for my purposes as well as some of the pros and cons related to each that may be helpful to other instructors.\nPhase 1: Google Forms\nFor the first few, I created reading guides in Google Forms that had  multiple pages, each one focused on a particular aspect of the reading. On the article itself, I added different color stars that I then added to corresponding questions. I encouraged them to use these to learn about the structure of empirical articles.\nRather than sending students the Google Form to complete, I embedded it in a Moodle assignment. (This is easily accomplished by copying the embed code provided by Google and pasting it into the assignment description as html.) This way, the reading guide appeared in Moodle just like any other assignment with the article attached.\nPros\nStudents are familiar with Google Forms and with the form available in Moodle virtually no technical support was needed.\nThe Form provided a clear step-by-step process for students to follow.\nThe Form gave students some idea of how much text was expected for each prompt.\nCons\nStudents had to complete the whole assignment in one sitting. Google Forms doesn’t provide the option of saving your progress, and a few students reported that it timed out before they were able to submit their work.\nGrading had to be completed using Moodle in one window and Google Forms in another.\nPhase 2: Google Assignments\nFor the later reading guides, I used Google Assignments. First, I created a Google Doc version of the reading guide. Then I created a Google Assignment in Moodle. The assignment description contained two links, a link to the article and a link to the reading guide with the instruction to “make a copy” of it. This way each student had their own copy of the reading guide as a Google Doc.\nPros\nOriginality reports are fantastic. At a glance you can see each instance of unoriginal text. The student can see the same when they submit their assignment and make revisions before the due date.\nCommenting is easy, and comments are pushed to students. As with Moodle, you can create a bank of commonly used comments.\nGrades are automatically pushed to the Moodle gradebook.\nCons\nStudents may need a bit of coaching on how to use Google Assignments, and with an instructor view very different from the student view, students often have to rely on each other or ITS for technical support.\nGrading is relatively slow. There’s a bit of processing that takes place between each student.\nGoogle Assignments don’t always load properly in Moodle. The most common issue is that they appear in a very small window, which the user has to try and scroll within to open the assignment.\nGoogle Assignment deadlines are not added to the Moodle course calendar.\nProject Assessment\nI thought both versions of this assignment were superior to my previous iterations. The academic integrity issues I previously noted all but disappeared, presumably because the formats were more difficult to share and discouraged copying and pasting. Additionally, in my estimation the quality of students’ work increased over prior semesters, which reflects enhanced understanding of  how knowledge is created in media psychology.\nI also solicited students’ feedback on the assignments. The vast majority of the 28 students agreed or strongly agreed with the statement that the reading guides helped them better understand social scientific articles. In terms of format, most students (54%) preferred the Google Doc version, some preferred the Google Form (28%), and a few had no preference (18%).\nLooking Ahead\nI don’t plan to use Google Forms again for reading guides because the Google Assignments were better in both my opinion and most students’. However, I have and will continue to use embedded Google Forms for other things. For example, during this semester of remote learning, I have used them to replicate in-class activities.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nBack to the Future … er, … Past\nNext Post\nMy Journey with #digPINS…Round 2!\n(3) Comments\nSusan Ashley\nApril 27, 2020 at 10:03 pm\nReply\nValerie,\nIt’s been my pleasure collaborating with you. I’ve enjoyed discussing ideas as you tried new ways to reach objectives for your course. Your blog reflection with comparisons for Google Forms and Google Assignments for your reading guide assignments could be very useful to others as they try to choose between the two tools when looking at their particular objectives.  Quick question, when referring back to the Bryn Mawr Digital Competencies Framework, which skills align with your implementation of this initiative?\nValerie\nMay 6, 2020 at 3:13 pm\nGood question! Under “critical making, design, and development,” item 5.4 is digital research and scholarship. This project helped students become “aware of both traditional and emerging processes of knowledge creation and dissemination in a particular discipline,” in this case the discipline of Media Psychology. The project also required students to engage in “digital communication,” especially 2.1 collaborative communication.\nKrissy Lukens\nAugust 7, 2020 at 3:10 pm\nReply\nValerie – since going paperless is something that is increasingly more important, I’m curious if you will continue to use this method this coming fall.

The class was truly special for me in a number of ways: 1) it was my first time\nteaching a hybrid class\nthat takes place both online and in person, 2) I got to try out a topic I love with\nadvanced students\nwho were equally fired up about it, and 3) the hybrid nature of the course was uniquely supportive of my early months of mothering a tiny person (who arrived at the end of the fall semester). The course gave me a purposeful connection to the college community I love while allowing me to keep a schedule that centered around the un-circadian rhythms of a newborn.\nSaid newborn and one of 28 small gouache paintings I did parallel to this class as part of #\nsketchuary\n.\nBelow I’m going to briefly outline the structure and weekly rhythm of our course in case you, like I, have never taught an online or hybrid course and don’t have a sense of what that means practically.\nIn our class we primarily used two platforms to host our work:\nslack\n, a free, private, group workspace for sharing messages, images, links, informal thoughts, and other work-in-progress (#WIP); and\nart389.katieries.com\n, a public website hosted as a subdomain on my personal site* and running WordPress. All students in the class were added to our slack team and were given user/author accounts for the WordPress site. Prior to the start of the semester, I stocked the class site with posts making up the content of the syllabus.\nI also posted the syllabus as a straight multipage PDF\nfor those (like me) who prefer their content a little more linear than the branching structure of a website. Students also got a Premium subscription to\nSkillShare\n, a website with thousands of curated and edited tutorial videos on creative techniques and concepts. I also asked students to set up a website through the college’s Domains program and to think about what, if any, work they wanted to post there. They were required to create an online illustration portfolio on their own domains as part of the final.\n* –  Side note: I learned I had not talked enough about formatting images for the web when my 14 students each uploaded files ranging from 1-2 MB and my hosting data got all but used up. Should have brushed up on my  “\nDigital Survival Skills\n” from Bryn Mawr’s Digital Competencies Framework.\nWe worked on four projects during the semester:\nan introductory assignment\nexploring gouache and our artist identities, a\nsurface design\nproject, an\neditorial illustration project\n, and a\nfinal self-directed project\nwith online portfolio. For the first three projects, I assigned students videos to watch on SkillShare, short essays to read and reflect on, and progress work to post to slack. We would post our work-in-progress and respond to one another on slack. We would meet in person at least once-a-project to touch base, critique work, or Skype with freelance illustrators. (Shout out to\nLauren Lowen\nand\nSam’s Myth\nfor being so thoughtful and generous with their time.) The bulk of our communication was online, but our final critiques were often in person.\nSam Smith, AKA Sam’s Myth talking with our class about his work\nIn thinking about what worked and what didn’t for this class, it is impossible for me to separate out the strands of the hybrid structure, the newness of teaching illustration, and the weird contracting time of early baby days. The things that I loved about the course, like the flexible schedule and giving asynchronous feedback, where also the things many students mentioned liking. Thankfully, some of the things I worried about didn’t show up as much in student feedback. I had been concerned that the lack of in-person lectures and relying on SkillShare for content might seem to students like I wasn’t delivering the goods in terms of What Teachers Do. Instead, SkillShare was an ideal platform for accommodating a variety of software preferences and levels of experience. Motivated and curious students could geek out on learning more advanced techniques. Less engaged students could speed through the tutorial videos at double speed. Or skip them entirely.\nIn proposing the course, I suggested that our digital communications would be akin to the back and forth of an art director and a freelance illustrator. The “digital” here is a feature, not a bug. While I personally missed the ability to “read the room” and to respond to cues in people’s body language and tone of voice, for the most part we had rich and constructive communication. Our group met face-to-face around six times over the semester. I think both students and I were grateful for our face-to-face check ins. In an in-person critique, we could deliver impactful feedback and answer an artist’s specific questions. While the asynchronous feedback we gave on slack was nice in that people could tend to it when they chose to, in-person feedback helps when the deadline is tight or when dialogue and questioning can be helpful to your process.\nAnother gouache painting for #\nsketchuary\nWere I to teach a hybrid course again, I’d want to spend some more time working with students to articulate, and set expectations for, what it looks like to have “good classroom community” online. At the recent D3 conference at SNC, speaker\nMartha Burtis\ntalked about the importance of letting students teach each other. Now I’m thinking about how I could better use the systems of our class (slack, email, and our WordPress site) to encourage and facilitate peer teaching. Similarly, this class was my first time testing out some of\nJesse Stommel’s ideas on “ungrading.”\nI am convinced that quantitative grades are not helpful in pushing students to make better art.

One thing I’ve been researching lately are brand communities, or how people form relationships with other consumers based on using a particular brand. For example, I’m a huge beer geek and joined a membership club for a brewery in the middle of nowhere Colorado. I’d go up every few months to pick up bottles and hang out with the brewer and other members. It was always a blast and I made friends with other members because of it. These communities have a lot of value to a company, but I wonder if they can be applied to digital pedagogy to get similar benefits. To me, this seems like a process similar to one we’d need to cultivate the learning environments that we hope to achieve in online classes.\nBelow are 4 principles of building brand communities (adapted from Fournier & Lee, 2009) that I think might transfer to building digital pedagogical communities. I’d love to get your thoughts!\n1) Strong brands (classrooms) arise from the right community structure – not vice versa. The strongest, most stable structures for a class would be one whose affiliations are based on close one-to-one connections, and so as instructors we should try to provide opportunities for members to forge many interpersonal links.\n2) Brand communities (classrooms) thrive on conflict and contrast – not love. By creating a sense of contrast (i.e., defining out-groups), conflict, and boundaries, it could strengthen group unity. I could see this being applied to some group activities (but definitely not all), or maybe framing the class to be against some non-real group?\n3) Communities (classrooms) are strongest when all members – not just opinion leaders – have strong roles. Everyone in the class needs to play a value-adding role (i.e., everyone needs to participate and try to be a part of the community). This can likely be done by setting up various assignments in the class.\n4) Online social networks (e.g., LMSs) are only a tool – not your community strategy. The online learning management systems should facilitate interactions and should be a tool to support classroom needs.\nWhat do you all think? Any of those seem wrong? Anything not included that you think should be? I’d love to hear your thoughts!\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nSmall Teaching/Big Learning\nNext Post\nReflections of Week 3 (in the middle of Week 4)\n(4) Comments\nReid Riggle\nJuly 15, 2019 at 6:31 pm\nReply\nAn interesting idea.  I am struggling a bit with the second point.  I would need to hear what is meant by “conflict.”   Contrast seems to be much more realistic.  If we are talking about the value of debating different perspectives as “conflict,” I see value there.  The discourse over ideas can help  to create new insights and resolutions can build a common understanding which could foster community.  But your beer example does not seem to have this quality.   Tell us more about this idea.\nMiles\nJuly 15, 2019 at 7:14 pm\nReply\nI think you’re right that contrast is more relevant for digital pedagogical communities, though conflict is similar (but a bit more extreme) to me. Conflict also relies on the idea of in-grouping and out-grouping, and that feeling apart of an ingroup is going to make you feel a stronger connection with others in that ingroup. There’s a lot of cool research about how just being part of a group makes you feel closer with others in your group (even if you were just randomly assigned to that group). In my brewery example, there is a sense of being part of an exclusive group that is distinct from other beer drinkers and other beer club members (e.g., people talking smack about another similar brewery in the Facebook group).\nIn my mind, the idea here would be to somehow set up the classroom in order to make everyone in it feel like they are part of a ingroup. I could see this process happening a few ways, with all basically revolving around your idea about seeing the value of debating different perspectives. Concretely, it could be setting up an activity that pits the class or groups against an idea (e.g., maybe an outdated theory that is only right in some situations so the students have to tear it apart as a class) or the class vs a devil’s advocate (likely the instructor – I had an instructor do this very well in college) about some relevant topic. I could also see it working as having many debates in the class where students are assigned so they work with everyone else at least once (this would be more difficult to set up but perhaps more engaging for everyone). I think it could take a lot of forms, but having a theoretical foundation could be easier in figuring out what those forms might take in the classroom.\nAlso, I should have said that don’t necessarily see a 1:1 carryover between brand communities and classroom communities – I just think there might be some insights from other relevant domains.\nalaina\nJuly 16, 2019 at 3:11 pm\nReply\nI especially like #2. I’ve been thinking a lot about growthful conflict and how we embrace/enable conflict in our work environment to create bonds. It is all about establishing a team mentality–I think back to being on sports teams in school and how quickly/easily it was to form a bond with my teammates because it was us against them. I like the idea of moving away from love as the centering force, especially in a classroom or work environment. What else can we unite over?? Great points.\nMiles\nJuly 16, 2019 at 3:26 pm\nDefinitely! I had the same experience with high school sports. I think the thing to watch out for as an instructor is making sure you manage the conflict appropriately, bc the flip side to this is that if someone is seen as an outgroup member by the class, then students won’t respond positively or productively to that person. So it’s vital that other students are not seen as outgroups, or that if they are, they are quickly rotated back into the ingroup (e.g., via continuously switching groups for debates).\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

He suggests that it is the authors’ best interest to publish in a more open access environment because it would benefit them substantially.

Leila Walker’s article in particular, reminded me of many of the conversations that I have heard regarding the rapidly growing field of digital humanities. In fact, panels on the digital humanities abound at the annual MLA Conference (Modern Language Association), or at least they have since I first started attending in 2016. This January, I attended several panels on the topic, and as typically occurs following these panels, the audience agrees that the work is very interesting but wonders how it will be evaluated for tenure and promotion. It goes without saying that such concerns are valid, especially for junior faculty.\nAnother idea that Leila Walker discussed that I found interesting was that of public peer-review. While I would have to investigate the specific examples that she gave to know more about them, the idea reminded me of an instance where a well-established scholar that I know invited various people to comment on and review a draft of an article that he was working on. He used Academia.edu to do this and although I decided not to comment on his draft (our main areas are different), I remember thinking that it was refreshing to see someone held in high regard show his scholarship as a work-in-progress. This is something that I would be interested in trying in the future.\n“Just imagine if we could all see our academic heroes struggle through peer review — our own reader reports might be less intimidating.”\n— Leila Walker, “\nBeyond Academic Twitter: Social Media and the Evolution of Scholarly Publication\n.”\nAs I was reading the information for this week, I had a utopian moment, a brief chimera, in which I imagined what it might be like if the internet was flooded with peer-reviewed information and open access journals. My quixotic vision did not last long, and the following segment from Bonnie Stewart’s piece really hit home: “But we cling to the academic publishing system because it’s a prestige economy. […] apparently they will have to pry it from our cold, dead, mostly-precariously-employed hands because there seems to be far more attachment to the impact factor of prestigious journals than to the possibility of changing things.” I hope that we begin to see more acceptance of online and open access scholarship, and I would like to read Stewart’s publication that she references in the blog post on the topic. I also think that the majority of scholars today would agree with Stewart that there needs to be a change in order reach a wider audience. The tides seem to change slowly in academia, but I do believe they are changing to widen the at times narrow concept of what “counts” as scholarship.\nSource\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nThe Scholarship Dilemma\nNext Post\nThe End (for now)\n(2) Comments\nReid Riggle\nFebruary 3, 2019 at 4:45 pm\nReply\nWe can’t change the world if we don’t try.

As an individual on the tenure track, I spend a LOT of time thinking about my scholarship and how to disseminate it. One of my biggest issues with academia is that more often than not our reach can be limited. Our scholarship may not necessarily be read by those we truly want to be reading it, and instead is just read by other scholars. As a sociologist, I can expect other sociologists or sociology students to read my work. As a social worker, my goal is to have somewhat of a broader reach. But, it’s a bit difficult when you have to constantly be thinking about tenure and how your scholarship will be “read”. It’s sad that we put so much value on peer reviewed articles and don’t truly take into consideration the type of impact our scholarship can do elsewhere. For example, my scholarship focuses on race and socialization in families. Many of the families in my research want to read my work, but don’t necessarily have access to the journals it’d typically be published in. That, or the format of peer reviewed articles is so out of reach that even if they do have access, it’s so boring!!\nThese readings made me start to think differently about how I can disseminate my scholarship. I’ll definitely be looking into open access journals as well as other opportunities to translate my scholarship to those I really want to reach, perhaps in Op-Eds. But again, I wonder how this will be perceived for tenure and promotion…\nAt the end of day, my research is about and for families. If they can’t access it or translate it, then what’s the point??? I struggle with what I’m “supposed” to do for tenure and what is meaningful and fulfilling for me. It goes back this idea of who has access to knowledge… who “deserves” this access?\nI’d be super interested in hearing how others navigate this dilemma!!\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nMy Journey with #digPINS\nNext Post\nReflections on Digital Scholarship\n(1) Comment\nAvery\nFebruary 2, 2019 at 3:45 pm\nReply\nCristina, thank you for sharing your perspective as tenure track faculty.

My most recent paper came out (finally) about the role of genetic resistance and chronic wasting disease in white-tailed deer. You can access the paper here thanks to the grant covering the hefty open access fee:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/19336896.2018.1474671\nScholarship, particularly in the digital world has been an area of interest for me especially in terms of access. The current publishing model is this: (1) Scientist writes paper based on research paid for by a grant often from a government entity – NSF, USFW, NIH… etc. (2) Scientist submits paper to a journal for peer-review, depends on the journal but most have very small administrative roles and few are paid. (3) Associate editor – unpaid – arranges review from two or three experts in the field. (4) Reviewers spend time reading, commenting, and evaluating the manuscript – again unpaid, but necessary for tenure and promotion. (5) Once accepted the manuscript goes from journal to the publisher for type-setting and generation of a proof.\nOnly the last step involves payment, my article for open access cost $2950 USD. The journal sees little if any of that money, the associate editor doesn’t see any, nor do the reviewers or authors of the research. There have been a number of studies looking at the costs of publishing, sure servers are expensive, and having the skills to prepare the entire publication is valuable. But in the age of open access and free exchange  of information, I find the current model troubling. Here is a figure from a blog that articulates my frustration much better:\nhttps://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2013/09/18/follow-the-money-what-really-matters-when-choosing-a-journal/\nFigure 2- trends in publishing. Data from American Research Librarians statistical summary 2004-2005 and 2010-2011\nIf it isn’t obvious from the figure, publisher revenues have gone up 4-5x the rate of inflation. Online availability came out in the early 2000s and they started bundling access, therefore lowering the individual cost of a journal but now institutions are paying for access to journals they may not need. Apparently they took a page from the cable company play book.\nAlternatives have come out including preprint archives and sites like Researchgate. Copyright comes into question as to what the author can and cannot post and where. Researchers have been slow to adopt these, in part because they lack the prestige and mostly because the ones with the influence to make changes are fine with the current model as their research funds and institutions can easily afford these fees. Small institutions like SNC are forced to find work arounds for access or in the case of publishing – accept limiting access to their work. For my work, I’m fortunate that I was able to pay for open access… probably won’t be the case for some of my other papers. So even if I rely on my network to distribute the paper and increase visibility, few will be able to easily access it. If nobody sees your work then what is the point?\nI’ll step off my soapbox now and get back to work.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nOpen source for content analysis\nNext Post\n#DigPINS January 2019\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

What does our institution owe us? – SNC #DigPINS","text":"Home\n>\nBlog\n>\nScholarship\n>\nWeek 4! What does our institution owe us?\nI especially liked Dr. Tressie McMillan Cottom’s piece this week:\nTo institutions: if you want the reputational currency of public scholars you’d better have institutional processes & courage to go with it— The Dr. Tressie McMillan Cottom (@tressiemcphd)\nMay 12, 2015\nI can’t believe this piece is 4 years old. I’d like to have a frank conversation as an institution about context collapse and how our (employees of the College) social media content is and isn’t part of the institutional memory, may or may not be scholarship, and what our authors’ rights are. I know folks who have been questioned by the institution for critiquing or calling out the practices, policies, or actions of the institution online. “In this moment we should call for institutions to state explicitly what they owe those who venture into public waters.”\nFrom this week’s McMillan Cottom’s piece, I linked out to her previous piece,\nhttps://tressiemc.com/uncategorized/forced-context-collapse-or-the-right-to-hide-in-plain-sight/\nin which she writes about media organizations borrowing tweets from randoms:\nContext collapse has mostly been about the control I can exert over how and when and where I perform the identity I think most appropriate for a situation. But what media organizations’ “tweet borrowing” does is strip me of that autonomy. They do this through a little idea called power. By virtue of being media and a company, these institutions are more powerful than little ol’ me. They have greater amplification power and more money to spend drowning out my resistance and more protection when they make a mistake than do individuals.\nAgain, what are our authors’ rights? Do we know how to respond to our digital scholarship being borrowed? How does digital scholarship coexist with everything else on the web? Are we taking the time to understand how much ownership we retain when we Tweet or vlog? We don’t have the rights of a public square on most of the popular social media platforms. And due to context collapse, are we ever not representing our institution? What does that mean for our digital scholarship? And how does our institution respond to that? And are we really savvy enough–as readers, analyzers, synthesizers–to recognize a scholarly tweet or blog post vs. a personal one in this age of context collapse? And if we’re not, then what?\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\n2\nbloggers\nlike this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nReflections of Week 3 (in the middle of Week 4)\nNext Post\n#DigPINS 2019\n(2) Comments\nReid Riggle\nJuly 16, 2019 at 4:58 pm\nReply\nBig, important, questions.

When I use Twitter, I tend to embrace the context collapse. No one’s work persona is completely separated from their other personas and vice versa, but that line of thought does have some unsettling implications for how accountable to my employer I might be on my “personal” social media accounts.\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

Can’t say I will blog again anytime soon but this sure has been an interesting journey. I find myself surprised to be wanting MORE!\nThis week’s material on dissemination of scholarship and access was fascinating. I was particularly intrigued by:\nOpen Access Explained!\nby PhD Comics. It broke things down to a basic-anyone-not-in-academia-can-understand level which as a non-faculty member (with a short attention span but fierce hunger to learn) I deeply appreciated. It is astounding that what is keeping these for-profit publishing systems alive is the perception of prestige. It seems like such a simple fix looking at it from the outside but monsters of our own making are often the hardest to defeat.\nOther than these bangin’ blog posts of mine, I have never published through any medium/on any forum but if it is something I ever aspire to do I will do it through an open access publisher. Higher education has under scrutiny over recent years and there is a constant pressure to prove our value. It’ll be much harder to prove our worth if we continue to bury valuable knowledge in journal subscriptions, fees, and other barriers. I admire the bold folks who have started the push towards open access.\nThank you again, for allowing me to participate in #DigPINS.

Information is now available to\nlarger audiences; however, this does not mean everyone has access to it. In the\nlast years, the internet has greatly contributed to the development of global networks\nand a rapid spread of information and ideas. In my field, I am able to find\nmore information now than I did two decades ago, however, I still struggle to\nfind particular pieces of scholarship. This was especially the case in a\nSpecial Topics course taught in Spanish during the fall of 2018. As I prepared for\nthis class, I realized it was almost impossible to find scholarship on Gender\nStudies, Film Theory and Violence readings in Spanish. When I did find\nappropriate sources, they were often times books translated from English to\nSpanish. This was problematic since much of the information changed meaning in\nthe interpretation.\nThis experience also made me aware of another important\npoint, I was reading books in Spanish, presenting in Spanish and publishing in\nEnglish. Therefore, my published work was not available to an important\nfraction of the audience in my field. Given the circumstances, it would make more\nsense to publish in Spanish but I was discouraged from doing so for various\nreasons.\nFurthermore, in doing research for the Special Topics\ncourse, I was surprised that the few articles I found for the course in Spanish\nhad open access. I would like to interpret this an indicator of a future where\nresearch is more accessible to everyone. Social media such as Twitter, Facebook\nand Academia are also being used to share research with a broader public. However,\nas Amy Collier discussed in her lecture, social media is also experiencing a\nspread of misinformation. This is also the case with scholarship, through\nsocial media I have encountered sources that are presented as scholarly pieces but\noffer misinformation.\nI am truly grateful for the opportunity of becoming a better digital citizen through DigPINS. It was a joyful and gratifying experience to work with everyone and to learn so much from our readings and conversations. I hope to continue the conversation through social media networks and look forward to seeing the near future of digital pedagogy and scholarship.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nThe End (for now)\nNext Post\nDomains of One’s Own… it’s just a website right?\n(2) Comments\nReid Riggle\nFebruary 4, 2019 at 8:15 pm\nReply\nThanks Judy.

Indeed, if most scholars in our field publish in English, then that presents difficulties in finding sources in Spanish that we can use to familiarize our students with the most current research (and relevant scholars) in our field.\nI have seen more scholars publish in Spanish recently, and when I was on the job market I saw that some announcements required a writing sample in Spanish, preferably a publication. However, if one is advised to publish only in English, then they would not have the necessary documents to apply for such jobs. This is definitely a problem.

However, given the current global situation, all my courses suddenly transitioned to online teaching. I immediately started exploring new methods to communicate and collaborate with students. I recorded lectures, scheduled video meetings, assigned online homework and exams, and modified the grade book on Moodle. I could not believe I was fully immersed in digital pedagogy! The grade book was particularly important as students were able to receive immediate feedback on their work. Exams, quizzes and online assignments were directly linked to the grade book and students had easy access to a grading rubric.\nFor this blog, I will focus on the original #DigPINS project which explored new methods of assessment. Throughout the semester, students were assigned an essay and a final research paper. The writing assignments went through a peer-review process that involved multiple steps. The end product was rewarding and productive, however, we encountered a few challenges on our path. The main challenge was in relation to logistics. Going over the peer-review process took an entire class period and would have been a disaster without Susan Ashley’s support. We arranged for Susan to join the class for the second part. For the first half-hour, I discussed the format and expectations for the writing assignments. Susan explained the logistics of the peer-review process and answered questions.\nAfter clarifying the expectations and logistics of the peer-review process, students submitted their work. Peers offered detailed feedback and suggested corrections. Moreover, the peer-review process encouraged students to analytically review an essay, critically reflect on the writing process and develop critical thinking skills. By offering the opportunity to do peer-review, students were actively engaged in the grading process. Also, students showed enthusiasm in sharing their thoughts about the grading rubric. I was glad to see students take an active role in crafting a rubric system which allowed for a more student-centered project. The peer-review task was an exciting opportunity to empower students to take an active role in their own learning. The project incorporated strategies presented in the Bryn Mawr model, especially digital communication and digital survival skills. Through digital platforms, students were able to actively communicate and collaborate on their projects and develop their reading, writing and language skills. Furthermore, students strengthen their digital survival skills as they learned to upload, download, edit and organize Google documents.\nIn this course, students showed an enthusiasm for the project and for the opportunity to collaborate with classmates in reviewing assignments. Comments regarding the peer-review assignments expressed an appreciation for detailed student feedback and recommendations for grammatical corrections. Through peer feedback, students were encouraged to analytical review their work and critically reflect on the writing process. Students reported peer review encouraged clarity, effective communication, and enhanced their work through an exchange of ideas.\nThe IT team was amazing! They offered their full support for this project, going completely online would have been impossible without them.

The goal was for students to be able to see everyone else’s work. I also wanted my colleagues in Art and outside of Art to be able to see the work. As it turns out I spent my efforts tackling three things. One was figuring out how to create a google form in order to have remote group critiques. The second was figuring out how to record and post video tutorials that I created for my Art350-Computer Graphics class. The third was how to set up a google meet while during the meeting I would share my screen so the students could see my Adobe Photoshop demonstrations. Not what I planned, however I am now better positioned to do online teaching and learning relative to my area of expertise.\nReflection on planning and implementing the project – questions to consider:\nHow did this change elevate student learning or personal scholarship?\nIt made the students think harder about evaluating their peers work because google forms formalized the process. The recorded videos that I posted in YouTube were a great way for the students to visit my tutorials more than once which was how I did it prior to posting. They would watch me demo and that would be the end. Now because the videos are online the students can view them at their leisure and as many times as they want to.\nIn what ways did this initiative build digital literacies, skills, and/or citizenship? Use the Bryn Mawr Digital Competencies.\nPretty much as described in my first paragraph. I can now do formal online critiques. I can also deliver content online through video tutorials and through google meet. These may seem minor to the digitally literate but for me they were major accomplishments. I am now teaching a Maymester course all online using the tools and techniques described.\nFramework to identify competencies that are aligned with the project and articulate how they did so.\nAs the Greek philosopher Plato indicated “Necessity is the mother of invention”. Because we all headed home and stayed home post spring break I needed to react and learn how to deliver content online in assorted ways.\nWhat resources did students need to be successful? These could include things like technical help with documentation, videos, or tutoring; specific software/hardware; accounts with specific services; etc.\nFor starters the students had to have Adobe software on their computers. They also needed web access remotely.\nWas there an assessment of goals? If so, what determined reaching these goals? For example, the use of peer review, self-assessment, instructor assessment using a rubric or checklist, quizzes, pre/post experience survey, etc.\nMy filling out this document is part of the reflection/assessment. Another part that was extremely valuable was the critique feedback via the google forms. I was able to collate the responses and send the critique reviews back to the students giving them a chance to re-work their projects based on the responses. Many of the students went back and improved their projects. The formalized nature of the critiques caused all students to contribute – something that does not always happen.\nWhen was the plan implemented? What was the length of time for this implementation?\nStart of Spring semester of 2020 and it is still going on.\nConclusion with possible projection on next steps.\nTo keep learning how do deliver content online. I have access to the Google meet plug-in which would allow me to deliver content to the 30 student class coming this Fall.

The “publish-and-read” model combines publishing open access (author fees or institutional fees depending on who is paying to make it open) and standard subscription fees (viewing paywalled articles) into one fee or a “publish-and-read” fee. This model strikes at the heart of many of the inequities in the current academic publishing model that we have discussed in DigPins and in our Slack channel.\nSeveral recent examples of “publish-and-read” deals have come out of the Netherlands.  A consortia of 14 Dutch universities successfully signed deals with\nSpringer Nature and Oxford University Press\n, as well as previous deals with other publishers, that guarantee all articles by university affiliated authors will be available as open access (“publish”) and the institutions will have access (“read” or standard subscription access) to a publisher’s content.  Institutions in Sweden, Austria and the U.K. have also struck similar deals with publishers.\nAll eyes are currently on Germany as the\nProjekt DEAL\nconsortia (150 + German university libraries) are\nattempting to broker\na “publish-and-read” deal with the publishing giant\nElsevier\n. While other institutions have signed “publish-and-read” deals with Elsevier, they have had to settle for less than desired terms – only 30% of affiliated Dutch articles were made open access rather than the full 100% that deals with other publishers guaranteed.  The negotiations just recently stalled as DEAL issued a press release on July 5 calling\nElsevier’s demands unacceptable\n.  The standoff has resulted in subscription cancellations and the loss of Elsevier access for German institutions associated with DEAL but it is a loss that libraries and the constituencies they serve seem to be prepared to weather as they seek a seismic shift in the current academic publishing model.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nHow Much Should I Know Before I Put it Out There?!\nNext Post\nDo you OACA?\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

However, I’d have been a major hypocrite if I wasn’t able to put my own (mixed with Tyson’s) advice into practice and adapt to the pandemic, so that’s what we had to do this semester.\nAlthough I had lofty plans of having MBA students create a Facebook Fan Page where they had to get a certain number of fans by the end of the semester and incorporating all sorts of cool metrics and analyses, that had to be put on hold due to the coronavirus. That doesn’t mean that I was unable to incorporate new digital pedagogical techniques into my class, and I was even able to obtain a bit of data from it!\nMy students (both undergrad and MBA) are required to complete a simulation where they create a brand new 3d printed carbon fiber bicycle and compete against each other to see who forms the best company (as evaluated in on 5 criteria). Due to a desire to be as adaptable and equitable as possible, I decided to switch it up where every student plays individually against the computers. Although this change exponentially increased my work (I went from 13 teams to 73!), I found an opportunity to collect data to determine factors that influence objective performance on the game as well as subjective perceptions of learning. The goal is to be able to use those data to improve how I guide students through the simulation. Also, more for fun than anything, I actually played the simulation (individually, against the computer like the students), which put me in a much better position to guide them throughout all the decisions they had to make.\nI’ve only been able to briefly analyze the data, but the results are interesting so far! First, it seems that students find tremendous value in the simulation across the board. Interestingly, this doesn’t seem to be moderated by objective performance, so those who do better don’t necessarily like the simulation more. Second, it seems that the teams that spend the most time making the required decisions are the ones that end up performing the best. This will be particularly helpful, as it is further evidence that the decisions students make determine their objective performance. There are a few more analyzes I need to run (when I finally get some time), but I’m hopeful to get a lot more insights. I’ll update the blog as I analyze those data!\nOne of the most beneficial aspects of being familiar with innovative digital pedagogical techniques is that it gives you the necessary tools to be flexible and adapt to the situation after you get punched in the face. These tools allow us to pivot and move so we’ll be able to counterpunch the coronavirus (or whatever it is that punches us in the mouth!).\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nUsing Flipgrid Videos and Breakout Rooms to help students discuss crime fiction\nNext Post\nNecessity is the mother of invention\n(4) Comments\nReid\nMay 24, 2020 at 1:14 pm\nReply\nTechnological adaptability is a critical skill.  You modeled that attribute in your course adjustments.   The finding regarding the time investment is valuable.   As you continue your analysis it would be interesting to know how the shift in the design of the simulation impacted the performance of your students.\nI am very interested in learning more about how the design of your simulation and the impact on student learning.  In particular, what are the underlying design principles that could be generalized to other disciplines.\nMiles\nMay 28, 2020 at 2:17 pm\nMy plan is to continue to collect these data, since I do the simulation every semester with my intro students and my MBA students when I teach that class, so I’m really interested in seeing how the results will differ across semesters and situations. So far, it seems that students really love it, to the extent that there might be a ceiling effect with the subective perceptions of learning (i.e., they all thought they learned regardless of time spent, competition, objective performance, etc.), so I’m also interested to see what the additional analyses tell us about how to best implement these simulations moving forward.\nThomas Bolin (Tom)\nJune 3, 2020 at 3:52 pm\nReply\nThis is an amazing assignment.

I made some progress, but I imagine if I were to continue teaching I likely would still focus on more traditional formats. I liked this work, and I think the students liked it, too, but I probably did not embrace it as fully as I could have, and in the future, am not 100% sure how I would approach it.\nIn the past I had a “blog” requirement, and a hope and expectation that the writing students would do for a blog assignment would be substantively different from more traditional writing they had done for me in other classes, and  I supplemented those assignments with “Top 10” lists of hints from a variety of sources. To some degree that worked, but it always felt like an “add-on,” of sorts. With this DigPins opportunity I hoped to remedy that notion, and to improve the course.\nTo start off on the right foot I actually engaged the services and professionalism of Susan and Taylor to help me think through a blogging opportunity as I developed my course, in ways I simply had not done before. So even though I had taught the course before and had utilized a blogging assignment, I had never consulted with anyone in ITS. That was incredibly helpful, partly from a technical standpoint, but more importantly from a pedagogical perspective.\nAlong those lines, i hoped to build student’s digital competencies in the area of writing in an online medium. From\nBryn Mawr Digital Competencies Framework\n, I focused on the following competencies:\nLearning to critically analyze and effectively communicate using digital-age textual formats, such as hyperlinking and non-linear narrative.\nBecoming familiar with and comfortable using a range of digital publishing or social media tools, such as blogs, wikis, WordPress, Twitter, etc.\nLearning how to identify the digital publishing or social media tool that is most appropriate to given audiences, topics, and content.\nLearning how to give credit to other’s creative work and original ideas, through attribution conventions appropriate for digital media\nTo help students do this, I asked Susan and Taylor to visit with the class in order to explain how the technology worked, and most importantly, how to approach writing in this relatively new medium. The idea of writing online was not new to them, of course, but the idea of writing to an online audience, with a concrete prompt and expectation, was new for most of them.\nIn addition, I received guidance about simplifying and clarifying a rubric I have used in the past. This helped me with grading, to be sure, but again, most critically helped the students better understand how to approach this work.\nMy goals for this work were primarily rooted in developing sound fundamental writing skills for this particular medium, and for the most part — based on grades students earned — I believe this happened. More quixotically, perhaps, one of the criteria I used in my grading related to students finding and expressing their “voice,” and that remained an ongoing challenge throughout our work together. My direction, again and again, was that I hoped to be able to pick up any piece of writing, submitted anonymously, and know for certain who had written it, based primarily on the tone, style, and content of the piece. That got closer and closer to happening, but very few of the students really embraced the opportunity to let themselves shine through, in ways that would perhaps be less appropriate in a more formal writing assignment. Were I do to this again, I would continue working hard to try to help make that happen.\nI asked students to submit blogs for six consecutive weeks, in part hoping to keep them continually improving, and to some degree that happened. As a late addition to the class, in the wake of changes to class due to the coronavirus pandemic, I have asked for one final blog. I will be eager to see what they have retained and what might be new, under these new life circumstances.\nI am grateful for the opportunity to build my own and my students’ digital literacy skills in this area, and were I asked to teach again I would be eager to take another step, or two, in the direction of continuing to explore ways to build these skills and to improve the course, overall, by continuing to incorporate digital media in meaningful ways.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nEnhancing Student Engagement to Promote Deep Learning\nNext Post\nUsing Google Tools to Promote Academic Integrity and Knowledge of Social Science\n(2) Comments\nSusan Ashley\nApril 27, 2020 at 10:21 pm\nReply\nCorday,\nThank you for taking a step out on a limb to create such an engaging and reflective activity for your students while growing their digital literacy skills.

Were I to teach this again, I would definitely continue with this assignment and would seek additional ways to enhance it.\nPart of my grading rubric called for them to respond to at least three others’ posts, and that was very positive, as well. Students complimented and complemented their peers’ posts, raised interesting questions related to the post and course content, and very positively encouraged one another all along the way.\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

Meh… #DigPINS and Digital Lab Notebooks – SNC #DigPINS","text":"Home\n>\nBlog\n>\nImplementation Report\n>\nPANDEMIC!?! Meh… #DigPINS and Digital Lab Notebooks\nIn these unprecedented times… this significant event in our history… this once in a lifetime pandemic… did I miss any other cliche openings to reference the mess that this semester turned into? I may be speaking to the choir (now meeting\nvirtually\nas singing spreads respiratory droplets), but participating in #DigPINS has made this transition to distance learning not nearly as jarring as others may have experienced. I was already prepared for delivering content online via Google Meets, students turn in PDF copies of their work in Moodle, and the text is an OER (\nOpenStax\n) available freely online. Teaching a lab based course though did present a challenge – how do you provide practical hands on experiences that students need for careers in the sciences? Spring break was coming and the rumblings were starting that we wouldn’t come back to campus right away, or at all. We were finishing our biodiversity module and still had some dissections left to complete that were originally scheduled for the weeks after break. I did consider sending them home with a fetal pig to dissect but the logistics just didn’t work out in time.\nSetting Up a Digital Lab Notebook\nIf I can look at the bright side of a global catastrophe, I was fortunate in the timing of my #DigPINS implementation project. While I could’t expose students to wet lab experiments, I could introduce them to digital laboratory notebooks that many top tier research universities and industry labs are using. So long are the days of  carbon copy paper, inked notes where a only single line through errors is permitted, and grainy pictures are taped directly to the pages. Thanks to the very supportive folks in ITS (Taylor Jadin and Susan Ashley) I was able to test a web based, open source lab notebook software:\nhttps://elabftw.knight.domains/\nTaylor and Susan definitely did the heavy lifting to get this thing online. This wasn’t a matter of clicking a button, but rather needed a web server and routing through knight.domains. Thanks to them, SNC now has its very own research grade digital lab notebook for classroom and research applications.\nAllow me to sell you on the wonders of this platform for scientific record keeping. If you are familiar with traditional lab notebooks, you know that there is only one record of the research experiment penned by students with only the most impeccable handwriting. You know that all of the information you need – units, dates, modifications to the protocol – are always there and formatted correctly. Lets not even go into how easy it is to sterilize a lab notebook and prevent cross contaminating your projects. Those of you who are not laboratory scientists reading this, please know every bit of that was sarcasm if it wasn’t already obvious. There are many drawbacks to traditional lab notebooks and many advantages to digital. For starters, the PI can create templates so that all experiments are recorded correctly and include all of the necessary information to repeat if  the protocol. Notes are typed, no longer will you have to guess if that student who has long since graduate meant to write 100 ul or 100 ml. Entries are stamped with the date, time, and user. Common protocols can be stored and copied in when needed. Sample databases, inventories, and SOPs can be stored in the digital lab notebook as well.  Users can include tables, photos, chemical formulas, and drawings. Progress is tracked with an easy to define color coding. Lastly, everything is backed up with tracking of previous versions.\nUse in the Classroom\nBack to this pandemic and how this digital lab notebook was a savior. Normally in this module of students would record observations and drawing in paper notebooks and I would be forced to lug around 48 of these things, each a slightly different size, some with notes from other classes, none in the format I requested to expedite grading. Using this digital lab notebook, I was able to assign users, assign them to different sections, and index each of the entries using tags for quick searches. Most importantly everything is accessible online so students can complete them from anywhere, I am able to grade them from anywhere, and I can save my tote bags for the farmers market. Since I couldn’t send them home with their very own pigs, I did have to rely on virtual dissection software for the remaining labs. However, students could still work on all of the pertinent skills in note taking and record keeping. Heads up, internal anatomy below:\nDigital\nCompetencies and Future Direction\nThis platform provides a lot of opportunities for students to build their digital literacy skills.\n–\nDigital Survival Skills\n: Networks and file management, Troubleshooting\n–\nDigital Communication\n: Collaborative communication, Digital writing and publishing\n–\nData Management and Preservation\n: Electronic data collection, Privacy, security and preservation, Cleaning, organizing, and managing data, Metadata\n–\nData Analysis and Presentation\n: Data analysis, Critical data visualization\n–\nCritical Making, Design and Development\n: Project management, Digital research and scholarship\nMoving forward, I will be spending time setting up the necessary framework for students to contribute work to the digital lab notebook both in the classroom and as part of my scholarship. I’ll need to expand on the tags, templates, and databases so that as students work their additions are consistent with past work. My experience so far has been nothing but positive.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nMy Journey with #digPINS…Round 2!\nNext Post\nUsing Flipgrid Videos and Breakout Rooms to help students discuss crime fiction\n(2) Comments\nReid Riggle\nMay 21, 2020 at 10:33 pm\nReply\nWow.

The idea of digital notebooks could extend far beyond the sciences. Whether working online or face-to-face, this type of record keeping may be preferred by students and instructors alike. The digital skills embarked by this type of assignment will enable students to take what they are learning here at SNC into the next phase of their life and to lifelong learning. I am looking forward to hearing what students think.\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\nWrite a Comment...\nEmail (Required)\nName (Required)\nWebsite\nLoading Comments...\nComment\n×\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

I had ideas for modifying my Spanish 389 special topics course titled “Murder, Mystery and Mayhem: Contemporary Latin American Crime Fiction and Film” to enhance student learning and increase student interest in the course. After talking with Susan Ashley about my ideas, she invited me to write a proposal to participate in this experience. This course previously had relied primarily on written homework to keep students accountable for reading and staying up to date with the material. I wanted to explore new ways of using technology and full spectrum learning to provide more variety in the ways we engaged with and discussed the crime genre in Latin American literature and film that were also meaningful and engaging for students.\nMy plan had several components, which included incorporating\nescape rooms\nor\nbreakout rooms\nearly in the course to help students with the development of reasoning and analytical skills (mimicking the process of deductive reasoning we were observing in classical detective fiction), skills for close reading of texts, and teambuilding. I also implemented\nvideo recordings using Flipgrid\nto replace some of the written homework assignments to help students reflect on and verbally express their thoughts about the texts they read or watched, visits to the\nvirtual reality\nroom to experience locations we read about in class (also part of my proposal), as well as respond to each other’s ideas. I was also interested in incorporating\nPodcasts\nin which students can create movie reviews “on the radio” or anticipate or recreate the endings of the stories and texts. However, I decided this was too many initiatives for the project and I felt a little overwhelmed at the time, so I decided to postpone this last component.\nI had hoped to incorporate breakout rooms two times during the semester, but moving to remote learning in March obstructed my plan and we were only able to do it once. Susan joined my class that day and helped me with set-up and observed the experience. I was very pleased with the results and will definitely use this learning opportunity again. I saw students step up at different points through the breakout experience and contribute their strengths and reasoning skills to solve the clues and help everyone break out of the “escape room” (a little locked box). I saw them try different ideas when other ideas didn’t work until they were able to open each lock. I also saw them, as Susan pointed out, move from working independently and distanced from each other, to working collaboratively and physically moving closer to each other as collaboration increased. I have to say, though, that my favorite part was watching them after they were able to break open the box. I had filled it with different types of candy, which they divided up between them and then sat and ate the candy while they talked and laughed about the experience and other things. The resources students needed to complete the breakout rooms were non-tangibles, basically. I provided all the materials and prompts and they provided the analytical and problem solving skills, the determination and patience for completing the task. My assessment of the success of this part of the project occurred when discussing initial observations of the experience with Susan while students were in the middle of the process and then when I met with Susan subsequently to reflect with her on the experience. Student engagement was gauged and assessed as part of the weekly participation grade for that week.\nImplementing\nFlipgrid\nvideo recordings into the course accomplished what I had hoped it would as far as elevating student learning, and became an essential tool when we moved to remote learning due to Covid-19. I had only anticipated requiring 4 Flipgrid video assignments, but when we lost the face to face aspect of the course, which is critical for discussion of the readings and films in upper-level Spanish courses, I added 5 more videos for a total of 9. It became a primary mechanism for students sharing their ideas with me and with the class and for simulating, as much as possible, the back and forth spontaneous exchange of ideas that the classroom had previously provided (for each of their own Flipgrids, they had to make short video comments of two peers’ videos through a commenting mechanism in Flipgrid). A concern I had was that in making their own videos and in their responses to others’ videos, students would only make abstract, superficial remarks i.e. what they liked or agreed with. However, I was so pleased to see how carefully they thought about their own responses and how closely they listened to each others’ videos and were able to critically evaluate their peer’s contributions in the course. They responded thoughtfully to specific points about narrative and filmic texts, their visits to the VR room and to critical essays on crime fiction.\nAs I anticipated, one of the biggest ways this project built digital literacies, skills and citizenship was through the framework of Digital Communication, as described in the Bryn Mawr Digital Competencies. As the semester progressed, students became more and more familiar and comfortable with using Flipgrid to share their thoughts and reflections as well as make video responses through the Flipgrid platform to ideas expressed by their classmates’ videos. I assigned prompts of different levels of complexity and gave them anywhere from 3 to 5 to 10 minutes to create their videos.\nAlso, this project facilitated building rudimentary Audiovisual Analysis and Production skills. Flipgrid is not super complex and is pretty intuitive, but it did allow for some creativity and personalization, as well as facilitate building basic digital storytelling techniques. For example, one student filmed all her videos at an angle in front of the same blue wall and another filmed his videos standing over the camera looking down. Many of them incorporated pets or family members in the snapshot they had to take in order to post each video. So they were thinking about how they were projecting their image and created a digital personality while filming their videos. I also anticipated that by using audiovisual media such as Flipgrid would give students the opportunity to more effectively communicate ideas because this platform allowed them to work on their verbal skills in Spanish, alone, through frequent recordings and with multiple opportunities to correct their verbal expression by starting their recordings over if they were not satisfied.\nThe resources students needed to be successful for this segment of my proposal was, primarily, initial technical help with setting up Flipgrid. Susan Ashley came to my classroom the first week of classes and helped students download the app and set it up on their phones. Students could also later set it up on their computers if they wanted to use Flipgrid that way. We did a practice video in class just to say hello. Then, following Susan’s advice, I planned to assign four additional videos during the semester to discuss course readings and films as well as reflect on the breakout room session. However, as I mentioned above, moving to remote learning necessitated an increase in the number of videos the students made and, because they were not able to discuss the course material face to face in class, allowed them a platform throughout the semester for expressing their responses to the various texts and did not lead, as far as I know, to feelings of burnout with the technology.\nIn order to assess the videos I created a basic 10-point rubric, which set the expectations for the videos: 1-4 points for the length of the recording (longer length suggests further development of ideas), 2 points for responding to all the prompts of the assignment, 2 points for thoughtful reflection and 2 points for commenting on 2 classmates’ videos.\nIn sum, I am extremely pleased that I had the opportunity to implement these teaching strategies and tools this semester, of all semesters. Not only did I see student engagement and learning enhanced, acquiring the skills I did in this experience set me up better for what I was to face during the second half of the course during remote learning, which obligated me to learn to use several other new digital tools in order to successfully teach my classes and to use some I was already familiar with in ways I had not used them previously. I seamlessly and successfully incorporated Flipgrid video activities into my Spanish 102 courses, partially supplementing the in-class participation component, which changed drastically when we had to move to remote teaching. My next steps will be to continue to use both Flipgrid, VR and breakout rooms in courses as much as the course design will allow and to explore opportunities to learn more about making Podcasts and to set up my own domain for future courses.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nPANDEMIC!?!

{"id":"35ef5853-a38a-4848-b0ab-3c3bb06870f8","url":"https://snc.digpins.org/enhancing-student-engagement-to-promote-deep-learning/","title":"Enhancing Student Engagement to Promote Deep Learning – SNC #DigPINS","text":"Home\n>\nBlog\n>\nImplementation Report\n>\nEnhancing Student Engagement to Promote Deep Learning\nProject Synthesis and Rationale\nI added a new assessment piece to my Human Anatomy and Histology course, called Intellectual Engagement Activities (IEA) to enhance student engagement with the material. In the past, students have waited too long to study for the anatomy exams (the first one is week 6 of the semester) and then are unsuccessful. To motivate students to prepare sooner and to help them self-assess, I planned to use Socrative, IEAs for lecture material, and dissection activities for lab material. Socrative is a tool that makes it possible to ask MC questions during lecture to assess student comprehension. IEAs were designed to promote collaboration between students as they puzzled out the response to higher level, problem solving questions. Dissection activities guided students during lab and encouraged them to work as a team.\nIn addition to the IEA component, I also added a digital tool called Virtual Microscope. Each Friday, we study slides to learn histology. We will use the microscopes in lab and also a digital tool: VM. The digital tool is a learning tool. Students can use this to review slides without being in lab. They can also create their own quizzes to prepare for lab exams. This is another tool that will motivate students to self-assess prior to the formative assessment.\nNote\n: As a result of COVID-19, I modified my original project. I dropped Socrative, but maintained the IEAs for lecture and lab material, and we are still using Virtual Microscope for histology. I added a virtual lab dissection experience whereby I show students structures that I have dissected and then quiz them on those. I also added an online resource, virtual dissection software, for the students. And, I added chalk talks, recorded lecture discussions for students to view prior to virtual class meetings.\nProject Results\nElevating student learning\nThe IEA assignments were successful on two major fronts: student engagement and community building. Students were probing the material and asking deep, thoughtful questions. I noticed that they (at least some of the students) were migrating away from surface learning or memorizing material. I noticed that students were asking higher level questions about the material for which they had completed an IEA. Students, themselves, commented on how the dissection activities prepared them to better understand lab material. For example, students were directed to draw a diagram of the branches of the celiac artery (there are three main branches and then several more from those vessels). Students reported that creating the diagram made it easier to understand the branching pattern we studied on the donor in our virtual lab experience. Likewise with the kidney assignment.\nAn unexpected, but added bonus, is that encouraging students to work together in pairs and lab teams created a solid learning community. These relationships between the students have benefitted them in the transition to remote learning.\nDigital Literacy Tools\nUse of Socrative and VM helped students to build skills in metacognition and life-long learning and collaborative communication. The metacognition piece is key to developing an ability to assess one’s knowledge and skills. This has been a valuable skills with the move to remote learning.\nAs students answer questions or compete with digital games during class, they are using a digital tool to make learning fun and more memorable while assessing their knowledge. Students have responded positively by asking more in depth questions in the future in preparation for exams.\nLearning to use VM for studying and beyond (they can explore pathology in addition to normal tissue study) helped students develop skills using digital resources in new ways that promote learning. Having developed a comfort level with online resources facilitated use of the new virtual dissection tool for some students. Likewise, using Socrative and VM, students became familiar with these digital tools and learned how to use them for studying. Students worked in teams for VM, thus, they developed collaborative communication skills as they learned to use the technology together.\nResources for success\nTo facilitate student success with the digital tools, I provided written instructions and also “walked” students through use of each tool upon introduction. For example, Socrative was introduced the second day of class using simple questions about the syllabus and student goals for the course. We tried a couple of variations of questioning format as well (e.g. competitive by individual vs. teams). The Virtual Microscope application, Biolucida, is a tool students learned to use the second time we met for histology. I created written directions and posted them to Moodle and then we used the program together during class time. Likewise, when I introduced the virtual dissection software, I walked students through a specific example, as we met virtually. This was supplemented with written instructions and a practice activity for skill building that related directly to content we were learning in lab.\nAssessment plan\nMy original assessment plan included a combination of tools. To measure student engagement, I planned on using Peer Review, student self-assessment, and a dissection rubric. Once we entered remote teaching mode, I modified my assessment plan. To assess student engagement, I am meeting with my two teaching assistants 2-3 times per week. Generally, the sense is that the IEAs are well received and definitely helping students learn the material. I offered to not have any more IEAs for the last two weeks, but students requested that we keep this piece of the course. Other methods I am using to measure student engagement include the virtual lab presentations and quizzing sessions. I assign each student a number and quiz them during virtual lab. Most of the students are quick to identify structures and thus, seem to be engaged in learning the material despite not being able to be physically present in lab. I was pleasantly surprised to note that students performed as well on exam II and lab practical II (online version) as they did on the first exam and lab practical (non-remote).\nImplementation period\nThe addition of intellectual engagement activities for lecture and lab and digital tools for dissection and the study of histology, occurred in the Spring semester of 2020. The project started in January, the first week of class and will end at the end of the semester.\nConclusion and Next steps\nAddition of the intellectual engagement activities for lecture and lab were very successful in elevating student learning. These pieces encouraged students to go past surface learning and explore the material more deeply. Key to this, it gave students some structure and/or ideas about how to learn more deeply. And, to build this skill out for future use, we talked about general strategies that would enhance the usefulness of this technique for any subject matter.\nI plan to continue using IEAs with a specific focus on how they can be combined with digital tools such as the virtual cadaver dissection and virtual microscope tool. Teaching students how to assess their own learning and how to probe a topic more deeply to enhance understanding is a very useful skill, for any course. Many of my students have been successful with the transition to remote learning because we were already practicing self-learning and metacognition skills and had developed a strong learning community.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nBlogs as a space for critical and collective reflection.\nNext Post\nBack to the Future … er, … Past\n(1) Comment\nSusan Ashley\nApril 21, 2020 at 3:17 pm\nReply\nDeb,\nWhen I read this blog, I think of a few phrases. Phrases like student engagement, student learning, course objectives, technology tool review, student feedback, and teaching flexibility come to mind.  It is evident that these things are important components of your teaching. This student centered approach elevates learning in your classroom, whether face to face or online. Your content delivery methods are pedagogically aligned. It is exciting to hear the results of the assessment scores during the second half of the semester. Learning the tech tools is time consuming, I know, but the benefits have certainly been obvious.\nStudent interaction and community are so very important, if you were to have taught this solely online, without the benefit of  the face to face relationship building that you had earlier this semester, what other activities would you incorporate in the remote setting to build community?\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}
{"id":"1f065275-a6e8-4758-b51c-dd1e6dfd81f2","url":"https://snc.digpins.org/my-journey-with-digpins-round-2/","title":"My Journey with #digPINS…Round 2! – SNC #DigPINS","text":"Home\n>\nBlog\n>\nImplementation Report\n>\nMy Journey with #digPINS…Round 2!\nThis past (crazy) semester I embarked on another digital journey with other faculty and staff from St. Norbert College. My particular project focused on my Ethnic Geography course and me utilizing my own Domain (website) more during the course. This was important to me because I felt like I needed to practice what I was preaching. In the course I ask students to create their own\n#knightdomain\nto host their own learning artifacts from my course. This is new to many of our students, and so they need focus on both content and\nBryn Mawr learning objectives\n. In the past, class information was put onto Moodle (or Google Classroom), and I felt that making this course design change gave me both more credibility with my students and also made me understand some of their potential challenges with developing and building a Domain.\nBryn Mawr Digital Competencies\nUltimately, the project tied nicely into each of the skills in the Bryn Mawr framework. First, the project tied to\nDigital Survival Skills\nas it involved at time uploading files. @TaylorJadin and Susan Ashley often helped me better understand items such as embedding PDF files, Google Docs, and Word Docs. This tooks some maneuvering as well with learning some basic code as the Google Doc’s often appeared very small on my domain and I wanted them to have more “full screen” features. Troubleshooting with SNC’s TechBar team was essential in this project and process for me and it also proved that life-long learning is really essential in everything educational – including digital skills. This first skill also helped me in developing and starting to manage my own digital identity which was complex as I wanted to both showcase my skills to other scholars and employers online as well as be effective platforms of sharing information with my students at SNC. It was great to have the experience of building this with experts who could really assist me with the process. Without them, I would not have been successful.\nMy domain also hosts a few blogs, which is something that I also ask students to do in my own courses and ties to\nDigital Communication\n. Writing blogs and hosting them on my domain was just another example of modeling for students and me also gaining perspective on the process. At times there was trouble shooting in this process as well trying to embed my Twitter feed with limited success on my own. The #TechBarStudents were very helpful to me in this process, and I know that quite a few of my students needed help with embedding Twitter on their Domains.\nDigital Management and Preservation\nwasn’t a main focus but certainly present in my Domain. As we speak, I’m trying to copy my Domain to my own platform for life (unfortunately) after SNC. There were also times that I worked with @TaylorJadin to back up my website before making modifications.\nData Analysis and Presentation\nalso wasn’t a main focus…but we did add JetPack to each of my subdomains to have an idea of how often and which pages were the most utilized on my domain.\nCritical Making, Design and Development\nwas more of an essential component in my project. There were times that I talked with @ReidRiggle about the overall organization and appearance on the website, along with @TaylorJadin. This was a process and something that continuously evolved, including a few theme changes.\nOverall this project was very collaborative with various members of the SNC campus and I’m very grateful for the opportunity to improve my own skills and also to better understand the hiccups and areas where my students need help in creating their own domains.\nElevating Student Learning\nHaving my own Domain enabled me to have an example for students and show modeling. When I asked them to organize their own Domain’s they were able to see my own organizational features such as my drop down menus. They also saw how my information was not just on my home page but that I had different sections devoted to different aspects of my course. While Moodle and Google Classroom are learning platforms, I also felt that having my own Domain elevated student learning by having more of a “student friendly” platform. I believe the Domain was more visually pleasing and allowed me as a professor more freedom to organize the course – which ultimately elevated student learning as course information was easier to follow from a student perspective. Throughout the course, my students have to tie their artifacts to digital learning objectives from the Bryn Mawr Framework, and it was a great experience for me to practice digital learning along with them.\nWays to improve and what’s next?\nThis semester was crazy, to say the least. In a “normal” semester, I would have loved to create my own podcast. Many of my students use this digital artifact on their Domain and it’s an area where I always seem to be giving tips…so it would have been great to dip my toe in the water and do a podcast. In the future and with more time, this is an area where I would like to grow and where I would like to ultimately use my podcast as an example for students.\nWith the shift in the semester, I also found myself really having to change some of my delivery methods (which also fits in nicely with the Bryn Mawr Framework) and therefore I did not have time to gather a lot of feedback from students in terms of the organization of my website and what could be improved.\nMy plan is to continue using my domain this next school year wherever I “land” and continue utilizing the skills and tools that I’ve learned throughout this process.

Kudos for investing the time in doing this. I agree, I’m sure it provided a more “human” platform for your course.

The digital skills acquired will reach way beyond the classroom or SNC. As you know, Covid-19 forced many to take their face to face courses and quickly transform them using an alternate form of delivery. Although this is not ideal, it seems you made the best of this situation for your courses.\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\nWrite a Comment...\nEmail (Required)\nName (Required)\nWebsite\nLoading Comments...\nComment\n×\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}
{"id":"bc38c420-0264-4f6d-8a6c-518e46141136","url":"https://snc.digpins.org/blogs-as-a-space-for-critical-and-collective-reflection/","title":"Blogs as a space for critical and collective reflection. – SNC #DigPINS","text":"Home\n>\nBlog\n>\nImplementation Report\n>\nBlogs as a space for critical and collective reflection.\nFor my #DigPINS implementation project, I added blogs to my Spanish 300 course, a course which focuses on developing students’ communication skills, both verbal and written, while also enhancing their knowledge of Hispanic cultures. My section of this course incorporated service learning in its curriculum, and students that were enrolled in the course volunteered in either the bilingual classrooms at Danz Elementary, or in their after-school program. By using Spanish to help others, one of the objectives of this class was for students see the value and purpose of language learning beyond the traditional classroom setting.\nFrom experience teaching, as well as from information that I have read while working on my own scholarship, I have come to view writing as intricately linked to thinking and the act of processing information. The idea is that by writing, we learn to work through our thoughts and communicate our ideas. Thus, when designing this course and choosing an implementation project, I knew that I needed to include a way to help students process their thoughts and reflect on not only what they were learning, but also on how they were helping the students at Danz Elementary through service learning.\nThese initial thoughts on writing and reflection were further reinforced through the service-learning literature I read that stressed the importance of including critical reflection in experiential education and community-engaged courses. Some texts that have informed my thoughts on this matter include:\nJacoby, Barbara, and Jeffrey Howard.\nService-learning Essentials: Questions, Answers, and Lessons Learned\n. John Wiley & Sons, 2015.\nKobrin, Michael, Melissa Smith, and Joanna Mareth.\nIntroduction to Service-Learning Toolkit: Readings and Resources for Faculty\n. Campus Compact, 2000.\nRoberts, Jay W.\nExperiential Education in the College Context: What It Is, How It Works, and Why It Matters\n. Routledge, 2016.\nWhile I could have assigned papers or journal entries to achieve the desired learning outcome, I ultimately decided to incorporate a class blog because I wanted students to have a space to not only reflect on their own experience, but I wanted to give them the means to do so collectively with their peers. The blog created an additional sense of community and camaraderie among the students in the course, since it provided students with a way to continue to engage with each other beyond the class period and it gave them additional opportunities to share and exchange thoughts and information.\nIn doing so, this project closely aligns with point number two, Digital Communication, in Bryn Mawr’s Digital Competencies Framework. More specifically with\n2.1 Collaborative communication\nand\n2.2 Digital writing and publishing\n. Through the blogs, students became familiar with the publishing tools in WordPress (in Spanish!), and they learned how to effectively communicate their ideas through their blog posts. I observed that for students this often involved not only developing a clear and informative writing style, but also an aesthetically pleasing post that visually communicates and compliments the ideas that the student expressed in their writing. Students also worked together in a collaborative fashion, commenting on the ideas and points brought up by their peers about their service-learning experience. It bears repeating that in this way they could express themselves individually, while also processing the service-learning experience together in a digital space.\nIn regards to implementation and assessment, Taylor helped me develop the expectations for the blog portion of the course and worked with my students to teach them how to post their reflections and comment on the posts of their peers (Thank you, Taylor!). It was decided that as long as students met the word length, and demonstrated that they were reflecting on both their experiences and on the experiences of others to their fullest capabilities, they would receive full credit. It was interesting to read the blogs and see how their relationships grew with the students at Danz over the semester, how they gained more confidence in themselves, and how they acquired new perspectives from their experiences.\nThe implementation of this technology had multiple benefits and helped students to meet other course objectives for Spanish 300. For instance, by giving students additional practice in the target language beyond the instructional setting, students greatly improved their ability to communicate in Spanish, which in turn gave them more faith in their language skills. In addition, by helping students process their thoughts and ideas, by the end of the semester students were able to successfully articulate how this service-learning experience helped the community, and how it changed them as individuals. The final reflection papers from this course were moving and it was apparent that students were profoundly affected by their experiences within the community. I believe that the blogs were instrumental in helping students achieve the level of depth and reflection that they demonstrated by the end of the semester.\nThank you, #DigPINS / ITS for all your help, resources, and strong commitment to student learning! None of this would be possible without you.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nTransitioning to Online Teaching\nNext Post\nEnhancing Student Engagement to Promote Deep Learning\n(1) Comment\nSusan Ashley\nApril 21, 2020 at 2:56 pm\nReply\nKatie,\nBlogs can be so powerful when used as a reflection piece for a course. Using this intentional and skilled activity can have a huge impact on student learning. As noted, with composing blogs, students had increased opportunity to use their target language in an authentic way, while building communio with their classmates. This experience has indeed fostered learning of digital communication skills with the writing and publishing of the blogs. Great job, Katie.

Susan Ashley was an incredible resource and offered many suggestions of how to accomplish this, including in integrating the Seesaw platform into my\nEDUC 317 General Music in the Elementary School\ncourse.  Through the use of this intuitive online platform I was able to film and easily share footage of the fourteen teachers-in-training demonstrating their competencies in “micro-teach” episodes.  Each student completed a total of five of these teaching demonstrations throughout the semester.  Students received feedback from me and also completed self-reflections and peer-to-peer evaluations.  Seesaw allowed me to easily organize, share, and evaluate their work.  For their final microteach Susan filmed all of the demonstrations using the 360 camera to allow students the opportunity to think critically about the teaching environment in their classroom as a whole, and not just to focus exclusively on their role as facilitators in the classroom.\nAt the conclusion of Fall 2019 I now have a total of 140 pieces of evidence that is organized in the Seesaw platform.  As this course has a second part (\nEDUC 318 General Music in the Secondary School\n), one of the goals will be to introduce both the Seesaw platform along with several other relevant digital music curriculum resources to students so that they can integrate these into their own classrooms in the future.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nWeek 4!

Marketing is becoming increasingly digital, and marketing programs need to update their curriculum in order to give students the skills necessary to respond to the changing industry (Rohm, Stefl, and Saint Clair 2019). The purpose of marketing education is to provide students with the skills and tools necessary to succeed as marketers, so it is essential that marketing programs adapt to the rapidly digitized marketing industry (Brennan 2012). An important component of offering students a valuable learning experience is to provide them opportunities to build their digital competencies to help them thrive in the digital world post-graduation. Students are increasingly required to manage and preserve data, to communicate digitally, to analyze and present data, to manage digital identities, and to make critical design and development decisions in a digital space (“Bryn Mawr Digital Competencies Framework” 2016). In order to keep marketing programs relevant, students must be given the opportunity to build these competencies while still in school.\nI used my Consumer Behavior marketing class to provide students with three opportunities to build digital competencies. First, students completed two digital marketing certifications (HubSpot social media certification and Google Analytics beginner certification) that are highly regarded in the industry and often required for digital marketing positions. Research also shows that these certifications help with job placement and success in the position (Staton 2016). Not only did this assignment force students to build their resume and be more attractive candidates on the job market, but it also allowed me to flip the classroom for that unit and give them a project to apply the knowledge they learned from the certifications. Specifically, I gave students real social media and website data from a local nonprofit that they were able to analyze and come up with recommendations for. I was fortunate enough to have access to these data and permission to share them, but it could have easily been done with fabricated data too.\nSecond, students applied the material we learned in class to develop a website for a brand of their own creation. Students were given the option to develop a website for a personal brand to promote themselves on the job market, for a brand for a company they want to actually create in the future, or for a fictitious brand (e.g., a fake clothing store). The college offers the Knight Domains service to students, which gives them server space and resources so they can develop their own websites or applications. The Tech Bar offers consultation and training in WordPress and its applications for students so over the course of the semester, students updated their websites and created their brand. Students also wrote five blog posts over the course of the semester and posted them to their sites. The first blog post was an intention post, where they created three personal learning objectives for assignment as well as tactics for accomplishing those objectives. Students then wrote three biweekly blog posts where they were required to relate the course content to their experience with creating the website. Finally, they were required to write a reflection blog post, where they had to reflect on whether they accomplished their learning objectives described in the intention post. After the semester, I got qualitative and quantitative data that suggested that students felt that they gained digital competencies and they felt more confident in their ability to be digital marketers after they graduate. I’ve submitted a proposal to present this at the Marketing Educators’ Association conference, so I’m hopeful I’ll be able to disseminate this and get more feedback on it in the spring.\nFinally, students completed the Buzzfeed Challenge (Cowley 2017), where they were required to identify a target market, create a BuzzFeed article or quiz that appeals to that market, and reach that market using online promotion principles and targeted influencer outreach. Their grade was, in part, determined by how many views they got (they needed at least 1000 views for full credit) and so their success was solely determined by the quality of the decisions they made. The number of views varied wildly, with a range of a couple hundred to more than 90,000! Students responded very positively to this assignment as well, and several students specifically said they learned more about marketing by doing the assignment.\nI was really happy with how these projects turned out. It really seemed like the students were really engaged with the assignments, and understood their importance in terms of portfolio and resume building. Even the students who weren’t as motivated as I would have liked are objectively more prepared for the job market than they were before the class started, so I love the idea of building digital competencies into the curriculum. I’m going to continue using these projects the next time I teach consumer behavior, and will add more opportunities for students to build digital competencies into my other classes. For example, I’m thinking about having my market research and/or my MBA class create a Facebook Fan Page so they’ll be able to analyze the relevant metrics and make decisions and changes using data that’s relevant to them. I’m really grateful to have had the opportunity to talk about these initiatives with other faculty and staff, so I really appreciate #DigPINS for giving me the resources and motivation to do so. I probably wouldn’t have done as much or been as successful without yall!\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\n#DigPINS 2019\nNext Post\nChanging Circumstances: Unexpected Benefits\n(4) Comments\nReid\nDecember 25, 2019 at 5:45 pm\nReply\nA strong articulation of the value of digital competencies, Miles!

This was a huge undertaking and a real revamping of your syllabus. Thank you for allowing St. Norbert College’s Academic Technology team and Full Spectrum Learning to be a part of this transformation. Part of SNC’s vision is to fully prepare students for success in a complex world. Your initiatives have given students the opportunity to gain digital skills necessary for the field of marketing and beyond. Great job!  If you were to change anything that you did during the course of the semester with this class, what would it be?\nMiles\nJanuary 6, 2020 at 2:59 pm\nThanks! I think I’m going to have to work out the logistics a bit better. I think I’m going to make the website a shorter assignment and only give them half the semester instead of the whole thing, so they don’t spread out the work too much and not retain as much. Strangely, I’m going to have to be a lot more strict with deadlines. I was very flexible given the nature of the assignments, which students didn’t like. Even though I never took points off for being late or changed a deadline to make it due sooner, students needed more structure. I’m looking forward to doing it again. Thanks for all your help!\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

How do we continue to curate our presence? As\nPasquini\nstates, “We can no longer use the expression ‘in real life’ or IRL, as your online self\nis\nyour real, off-line self. In addition, how we behave inside the screen, on the web and in our networks has real-life implications for our selves outside a device, platform or digital space.”\nThis is very interesting to me because I can remember a time when there  was a clear distinction between our online selves and our IRL selves,  especially in the early days of Facebook and Twitter. I still find  myself wanting to take to the Internet with thoughts or opinions I  wouldn’t necessarily express IRL. As  a result, I am very interested in thinking about– as\nStewart\nasks, “who are you talking to?” when you sit down in front of a screen or swipe  up on your phone. And as we think about the spaces we hope to curate or  contribute to, I’m becoming increasingly interested (given our current  moment of #MeToo) to apply critical whiteness theory to my understanding  of digital identity. Critical whiteness theory is meant to reveal the  invisible structures that produce and reproduce white supremacy and  privilege. Even though women and people of color use the Internet to  share their stories, the Internet is still a place where people can be silenced. The Internet is not a guaranteed safe space for women and  people of color, just like IRL spaces can become unsafe. How do women  and people of color curate safe spaces or respond to unsafe spaces? Is  the only option to leave said spaces, as many are doing?\nFurthermore,  I was thinking during the visitor/resident discussion how our digital  identity is being tracked and we’re always leaving a trace, even if  we’re not engaging. What are those implications for our digital identity?  How does that affect the way we cultivate our presence online and  engage with others? The communities we enter? What is the role of  consent in our online spaces? In terms of IRL harassment and violence,  it’s not the dark alleys that are the most dangerous, it’s often the  places and people you know and trust, it’s the places you frequent, that  can become unsafe(est). These are a few of the things I’m interested in exploring during #DigPINS.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nANXIOUS BLOGGER\nNext Post\nExploring My Digital Identity\n(2) Comments\nTaylor Jadin\nJune 27, 2019 at 12:34 am\nReply\n“How do women and people of color curate safe spaces or respond to unsafe spaces?

{"id":"336fc6d7-7fc9-4fd7-9b89-39e3c149b0ec","url":"https://snc.digpins.org/my-journey-with-digpins/","title":"My Journey with #digPINS – SNC #DigPINS","text":"Home\n>\nBlog\n>\nImplementation Report\n>\nMy Journey with #digPINS\nby Parisa Meymand\nSource\nWhat will follow is a summary of the weeks I spent in #DigPINS, but if you’d like to jump right to how I implemented this in my own class – jump right down to\n“Now what?”\nThis past summer I embarked on a digital journey with other faculty and staff from St. Norbert and Kenyon College, facilitated by @autumm (SNC) and @joefromkenyon (Kenyon).  This journey focused on digital pedagogy, identity, networks, and scholarship.  Each week, we explored a topic as a community and discussed in #slack, twitter, and in our weekly blogs. The framework for #digPINS comes from University of\nMary Washington’s Domain of One’s Own\n.  My original interest in #digPINS stemmed from an opportunity for professional development focused on digital literacy and the opportunity to get to know more colleagues in a shared community type of setting.\nSource\nWeek 1\nfocused on the idea of digital #identity, and one of my favorite activities involved creating our own\nvisitor-resident map\n(save your artistic judgement, please),  where we identified sites where we noted what social traces we left behind on these sites.  For me, this ranged from sites like Google and Amazon to YouTube, Twitter and Instagram.  It also revealed the way in which I use the internet varies – with Twitter being the place for more professional relationships, and Instagram as more of a place to post family photos and other fun things like vacation(s)!  This also helped me get more comfortable with using Twitter as a medium for #digPINS, as there is a personal desire to keep professionally growing in the areas of geography and education.  This idea was also verified in our weekly readings, including\nthis piece\nby Laura Pasquini.  Sometimes my identity manifests as geography education, and other times just as an educator interested in cultivating best practices and listening to other educators.  Also, noting my dual identity of educator and geographer was important moving forward in terms of thinking ahead to the idea of networks in week 2 .  I started browsing Twitter for ideas on digital identity, and came across\na video from the Economist\nthat discussed the notion of identity and gender differences.  For example, women are often described as bossy and men as assertive – although today this is a bit fuzzier (thankfully).  I thought of the notion of digital identities and how people who may not be familiar with someone may perceive them online.  Intellectual and kind…words I think of for my own identity.  How do they translate in the digital world?  Week 1 was winding down and I knew that it was time for our first blog.  We set up accounts for blogging with #WordPress and dear God, did I struggle with logging in and remembering my password.\nNote to self – help students here with this same struggle.\nSource\nAfter the uneasiness of getting through the login, it was now time to blog.  Did I mention that I’ve NEVER blogged before?  Looking back, my first blog was really rather specific and not all encompassing of\nWeek 1\non identity.  But, I found a topic that was of some interest, and I went down the rabbit hole.  I’m thankful that while we had to post our blogs, the first week we were not required to tweet them out.\nNote to self – remember this thankful feeling on week 1!\nSource\nWeek 2\nfocused on networks – one, if not my favorite week in #digPINS!  The focus of networks focused on how we interact online, and how we find and build our networks.  Since my identity consists of education and geography, I looked to build both of these realms.  My list of followers grew to include orgs such as @eduationweek, #digPINS members from SNC, @fastcrayon, @aag, @Americangeo, @WisDPIsocstu.  Of course, @autumm put together a\nlist of people\nto follow as suggestions.  My classic Twitter-verse consists of logging in, browsing what the people I follow are saying, looking for interesting articles, and retweeting them with a comment.  I’m still a work-in-progress as far as simply interacting with someone on Twitter if it doesn’t involve a retweet.  This week we now had to take the next step and not just blog, but then tweet the blog.  Here we go!  Looking back at\nweek 2’s blog\nagain really did not relate well (or as well as it should have) to networks, but more in my attempt at getting comfortable with writing out in the open on any topic.  During our networking week, I probably did read various posts about testing, and group tests versus individualized, and I felt like I had a strong enough opinion to express it.  This should have been connected more clearly in my post.\nWeek 3\ncentered on pedagogy.  I thought of ways that I use digital space in my courses – and the answer is quite often – as I teach hybrid courses!  The first word that I saw was “space” and part of my own identity wanted me to delve deeper into the concept of digital space, and just space in general for students.  It brought me to thinking about my own classroom space when I taught at the high school level, and how much I valued (and still value) space.  My feelings were so strong about this idea of classroom space, that I tied it to geography and my blog for\nWeek 3\n.  I realized that my blogs were my missing visuals, and so here’s a visual of my classroom to tie into week 3’s blog.  This particular photo (taken with their permission) doesn’t show off the seating arrangement in great detail, but you can still see traditional desks, “rolly” desks, circular tables, and rectangular tables during our “poetry slam” of agricultural geography.  Yeah, think about that!  Beyond the blog, I started re-examining what digital skills I wanted my students to come away with from my course.  I certainly have a better idea of this concept with #digPINS as a framework.  One article that I found particularly helpful was\n10 Things the Best Digital Teachers Do\n– I laughed at #6 probably haven’t listened to #9 enough, and love the added #11.\nfrom Parisa Meymand\nWeek 4\n– our last week!  We focused on the notion of scholarship and accessibility in our field.  I focused primarily on geography this week, and looked at identifying some “open” resources that are available.\nThis video\non open access by DC Comics was a good starting point for me to start reflecting.  One of my favorite open access geography sites is from\n@ProfessorDixon\n, where he curates geography using a thematic approach.  In terms of open access texts, there wasn’t really much out there in the geography world.  Read more about open access in\nblog 4\n, including a great content analysis tool I’m using called Voyant (@VoyantTools).\nNow what?\nAfter a great 4 weeks, I started processing what aspects from #digPINS to implement in my Fall 2018 course.  I decided to focus on WordPress, and having students blog and tweet their blogs, something that I grew to enjoy in #digPINS.  Since the course is set up in two-week modules, I decided to have students write and post a blog for each module. I wrote up my proposal, and away I went.  Looking back, there were some mistakes that I made myself that I should have learned from in implementing the blog in my course. For example, my first note on the login/password issues!   I never talked to students about the fact that they would need to really write this down and remember, I just assumed they should figure it out! After the semester, this is something that I brought up with Learning Technology Specialist, Taylor Jadin (@TaylorJadin).  He recommended making this more intentional, and making a blogging FAQ sheet for questions about logging in, and remembering passwords (with explicit tips like, write it down, sign up for lastpass).\nSource\nThis semester, I’m continuing the blogging aspect, and so this time around my words, I think, were much more direct and overt with my students, and I think they found the discussion helpful.  Another 1st-time-around mistake: I had students blog and tweet their blogs on week 1.  This semester, I’m resolving this issue by following our #digPINS example of just blogging the first week, and then week 2 (or in my case, module 2) worrying about tweeting the blog.  Yet another first-time mistake: thinking that I had talked enough about the importance of having a digital identity and creating a professional network.  My students are NOT geography majors (we have no majors), and so I was not overt enough in stressing that any field values skills (including digital and geographic skills), and are worthy of display.  I talked more this semester about students building their portfolio of skills for future employers, and how geography is a portion of that portfolio.  Of course, this happened with discussion from colleague and friend, Reid Riggle (@ReidRiggle).  This discussion on the importance of skills, and building their own portfolio should set and better frame our semester of blogging, and highlight more of the purpose of their blogs.  We also read two articles that discussed how important\ndigital literacy\nis in today’s\nworkforce\n, and in ways in which students may have not considered.  #digPINS has been an eye-opening journey for me in promoting digital skills for my students to produce better candidates for the future job market, and also for me reflecting on my own digital practices.  The journey continues!\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nBeing Gullible in a World Filled with Fake News\nNext Post\nThe Scholarship Dilemma\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}
{"id":"8b8a9d4a-28f7-44e6-a985-ce331cb2a1fd","url":"https://snc.digpins.org/digpins-project/","title":"#DigPINS Project – SNC #DigPINS","text":"Home\n>\nBlog\n>\nIdentity\n>\n#DigPINS Project\nCCO: Photo by rawpixel.com from Pexels\nThe opportunity to participate in the spring 2019 #DigPINS cohort experience changed the way I think about digital media, engage with technology in my everyday life, teach and do research. Throughout our weekly blogs, conversations, and frequent visits to IT, I was able to learn more about topics, such as digital pedagogy, research, citizenship, identity, and networking.\nReading articles about digital citizenship reminded me of the important responsibility I have as an instructor, researcher and friend to critically examine, not only the information I share on social media, but also how I share it. After reading an article on Creative Commons and meeting with Taylor and Autumm, I realized that my pedagogy relies heavily on videos, photos, audio, and other digital sources available online. However, I was unsure if the sources I integrated into my teaching were part of a Creative Commons domain. This led me to revisit much of my work and, in the process, I realized I didn’t use any Creative Commons material. I immediately started redoing all the audiovisual information I had publicly shared with students.\nThis was not an easy task, but it was highly rewarding, as I began to explore multiple Creative Commons platforms legally available to share creative and innovative work produced by individuals and communities all over the world. For weeks, I visited endless websites and came across hundreds of magnificent photos and videos that vividly showed Latin American culture and history. The discovery of a Creative Commons domain and the endless possibilities available there, led me to an idea, to ask my students in a Spanish Conversation, Composition and Culture course to explore Creative Commons domains for their final research paper and oral presentation. They were required to critically examine audiovisual productions and class readings for their projects. I was impressed, not only by their ability to comfortably navigate different Creative Commons domains, but also with the detailed research they presented. The photographs and videos, which the students analyzed for their final oral presentations brought diverse peoples, cultures and cities into the classroom. The angles, colors, lights, sounds, and many perspectives reflected in the photographs and videos, allowed for the class to better understand the given culture. The integration of public domain sources facilitated cultural awareness and empathy with other civilizations. Their presentations were connected to in-class readings, yet the students had complete autonomy to select outside audiovisual sources to support their research.\nFurthermore, after my first blog experience through #DigPINS, I decided to create a classroom blog, where students shared their opinions on class readings and films. The blog significantly helped students to select and develop a research project that linked in-class readings to outside sources. Every other week, students wrote a formal reaction to the readings and also commented on someone else’s blog. In their posts, students shared important observations and posed relevant questions. I was quite surprised by the in-depth analysis the students demonstrated in the works assigned and also by the sense of community that was thereby created. This safe digital space encouraged student engagement in a way I had not seen inside the classroom. Students were honest about expressing their thoughts and demonstrated a level of comfort to say whatever was on their minds. Their candid responses encouraged an interesting in-class dialog that allowed me to call on students to elaborate on their answers. The blog helped everyone in the classroom to actively participate. In fact, this was the first class to receive an A average for their participation grade. This was truly a unique class, and I was fortunate to share my digital media pedagogical knowledge with them. I am thrilled to think of what will come next in other classes.\nAnother component, which I explored this past semester, was Moodle. For the first time, I used Moodle to post all letter grades and share class material in designated folders. I found this method extremely helpful, as all expectations, resources, and grades were readily made available to the students. Films were also uploaded on Moodle, and the students could access them through their phones, tablets or computers.\nMoreover, the #DigPINS experience also helped me to rethink how I conduct my research and integrate it into my teaching. In the future, I look forward to using social media platforms to further advance my research agenda and connect them to special topics courses. I look forward to working on sites such as Academia and Twitter, in order to connect with academics in my field.\nI am uncertain as to what the next project will be, but I am excited to explore the possibilities of what I can do in the classroom with an iPad.

Many envision a science lecture and immediately mental images are conjured of multiple choice scantrons, long lists of taxonomic groups, and probably a balding professor with white beard and tweed jacket droning on in front of hundreds of students. Creativity is stifled because facts are facts and there is no room for interpretation. I read\nBut You Can’t Do That in a STEM course!\nand the many public annotations. I found myself writing and deleting comments and having a hard time putting my thoughts into words. As a biologist and someone who teaches the very same topics described in the article, I felt I needed to defend the way we do thing. The more I read and the more I re-read, I realized that maybe each teaching strategy is being viewed as if the entirety of the course if being taught that way. I have never taken a course where the professor stood up and just told me to memorize a list of items or that this sequence of topics is the only way to learn the material. As a wildlife geneticist I have had to memorize countless species names, structures, and biological processes “including all of the details of atomic structure, bonding, molecules, chemical properties, macromolecules like DNA, RNA, protein structure and function, cell structure and function, DNA replication, transcription, translation, cell cycle, etc.” But this was just one part of the learning process, and it wasn’t until I had an unexpected disconnect from the digital world that I was able to piece together some thoughts.\nLong story short, I was in the field with some students catching mice to estimate population size and doing a general biological inventory of the surrounding habitat. I was able to access mobile internet the year before but something was different and I could barely make voice calls. Oh and I was on an island 8 miles into the bay – but we did catch some cute critters.\nHiking about 8 miles a day gives you a lot of time to think and thoughts to rattle around in your brain. Open pedagogy, OER, rote memorization, inspiring lifelong learning… a little of that annoying song that wont get out of your head… that is what I thought about over several days. Turns out I was already engaging in open pedagogy through directed research. My students develop research questions and together we teak and existing project or create a new one to answer the question. My student likes birds, reptiles, amphibians, mammals? Well we don’t offer those courses (yet). I don’t know if you’ve ever done a biological inventory but it basically means hike around and ID whatever you can and use a field guide for whatever you can’t. Make notes about your observations, measure this, count that… it goes on. In way we were very much taking the same approach in Robin DeRosa’s\nMy Open Textbook: Pedagogy and Practice\nand allowing the students to fill in the gaps, learn the basics, and hopefully leave with an appreciation for the subject matter and desire to learn more on their own as we go through the scientific process and ultimately publish a report.\nDid this happen? Maybe. I could run this same study as a full semester course taking the same approach. Would the students leave as experts in wildlife and biodiversity? Probably not. At best they would be able to identify the species, behaviors, and environmental characteristics specific to that one environment. They may go off and try to learn more on their own but I have woefully underprepared them if they are to apply this in anything other than a mixed hardwood forest in Door County. Here is where I make my connection to the title of this blog. To say one thing is better or worse than another is like opening your tool box and saying a hammer is antiquated and you can’t just hammer everything to get the job done. Things hammered together are just going to fall apart in a short time. The reality, sometimes you need to hammer something together and sometimes you need to glue. Sometimes the job is done by a saw or some specialty tool. Pedagogy has to be the same. If my students had taken the time to memorize the calls of different birds, or the phylogenetic relationship among amphibians (literally just lists of things) then I could have better explained animal behavior or they could have asked better questions about ecology rather than “Dr. Brandt, what is this critter?” There is a time for rote memorization, and that shouldn’t be a bad thing. There is a time to allow students to take a topic and work through it backward, forward, sideways, or however they want. Sometime you need to cover topic in a specific order so you know the basics and can apply them in more complex situations.  We are the expert in these fields and we teach in that order, not because it is the only way, but because it is the most effective way to lead a novice through very complicated subjects. You start with molecules and bonds so that the student can not only grasp more complicated topics but to give them the tools necessary to make connections to new topics. If my student understands atomic structure and bonding first then they’re going to understand transcription and translation, which means they’re going to understand what it means when this cancer is caused by the overexpression of a particular gene but another cancer is caused by a failure in cell death signaling. I could even throw a hypothetical cancer into the mix and we could discuss how breakdowns in those basic processes will lead to the development of a tumor.\nI once had a conversation with a colleague about the future of education. He was convinced open learning platforms like Coursera would eliminate the need for us professors and brick and mortar institutions. I told him I wasn’t worried for the same reasons as above. All of these digital resources or only effective when applied in the right situation. As my students learned this past week, field work is hot, mosquito bites hurt, mice do not cooperate, and keying out trees is not that easy. They couldn’t learn this in an open course; however, there are courses like R programming, or bioinformatics that I would (and have) encouraged my students to take to augment the skills they gain here.\nI guess pedagogically speaking that makes Google search essentially duct tape.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nDigital pedagogy outside the classroom\nNext Post\nTeaching the Teachers\n(1) Comment\nBrian Clair\nDecember 1, 2020 at 5:36 am\nReply\nLearning a pedagogy is something new for me.

Then, as is often the case, it was the end of the semester and I missed my opportunity. Thankfully I had plans to start using the same program with the Jazz Ensemble in the spring of 2020. For that course I was going to introduce some easy improvisation lessons (12-bar blues, ii-V-I progressions, etc.) and work on them as a group during rehearsals. All we had to do was get past the Winter Band Festival concert in mid-February and the Big Band Snowball in early March. Then I would be able to record the planned video to share. Long-story-short…no video. Classes have been moved on-line and I once again missed the opportunity.\nHowever, I was able to find other ways to reach students using the IPad during these unusual times. In Evolution of Jazz I will often sit at the piano and show the class how the music is put together or how one style differs from another. My piano skills are not particularly good (I’m a trombonist) but over the years I have found a few pieces that highlight different styles and can fumble my way through them while getting the point across. So in an attempt to share that experience with the students on-line, I set the IPad up on a music stand and recorded myself at the keyboard. After that it was easy to share with everyone in the course. So easy in fact that I think a great summer project will be recording a few more tunes and having them available for students to view before class or before exams. Stay tuned for more tunes!\nThis is the video introducing Modal Jazz to the class.\nSign in\nLoading…\n{\"id\": \"1DTgu5Zt1VQl0CU-Z1tdN3HJ8saEccWEZ\", \"title\": \"Modal Jazz introduction (So What \\x26 Impressions).MOV\", \"mimeType\": \"video\\/quicktime\"}\nDisplaying Modal Jazz introduction (So What & Impressions).MOV.\nIf the embedded video does not play for you, click here.\nFor reference, we just finished talking about much more complicated styles of jazz like Bebop, Cool, and Hard Bop. By contrast, Modal Jazz uses far fewer chords and requires a different approach from the soloists to maintain interest while the harmonies change more slowly.\nMy biggest takeaway from our DigPINS experience may be the flexibility gained by incorporating more technology in the classroom. I can always revert to more traditional methods when necessary but it is great to have these resources available when the time comes to try something differently.

Her masters level students create podcasts about topics impacting today’s college students.  I appreciate this method of encouraging students to learn technology tools as well as to consider interacting with students outside of their own experience.  She is thinking outside the box in terms of how to help her students learn while sharing their learning with others.\nI enjoyed reading about Robin DeRosa’s experimentation with open textbooks.  In\nthis post\n, she wrote, “But a textbook is a textbook, and they saw it as neutral at best, uninspiring or frustrating at worst  I was just looking to replace a textbook and save some cash for strapped students. Boy, did I underestimate the power of the open textbook.”  There are so many connections between the type of work Robin DeRosa is doing with open textbooks with the work of academic service-learning. Robin is giving students an opportunity to really interact with the material.  They are helping others and making connections beyond sitting next to one another in a classroom. This learning is parallel to the learning done in academic service-learning.\nIn the article, “\nBut You Can’t Do That in a STEM Course\n,” Karen Cangialosi encourages the idea of having students share their research as they are developing it.  She writes, “ If we model ways for students to be transparent about all of the stages of the research process — encouraging them to publicly post and openly license their methodology and data long before it is polished into a final paper, they can receive broad and sometimes expert feedback on their work.”  That statement reminded me of part of Angela Duckworth’s book entitled\nGrit: The Power and Passion of Perseverance\n.  In the book, she shares about the process of developing\nher TedTalk\n.  She reflects on the fact that we do not see the iterations of talks that it took to get from the first draft to the final, polished product.  It takes perseverance to work behind the scenes to create a meaningful product. We should give students more opportunities for their work to be praised and critiqued in a public way as they are developing it.\nI will continue to reflect on how to use digital methods in the work I do outside of the classroom.  There are so many ways our students already connect to one another, how can we create more ways for them to connect with others outside of our campus?\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nBut I thought geography was just about maps?!\nNext Post\nPedagogy Toolbox\n(1) Comment\nSarah\nJuly 17, 2018 at 7:38 pm\nReply\nIs there a large field of scholarship on service learning?

A large portion of my job involves meeting with faculty and staff at the college, helping out with or facilitating different activities in classes, and participating in other various meetings. Obviously all of that is has been happening online now since March.\nTo make sure people can hear me clearly on video calls I have been using different headsets and microphones instead of the built in microphone on my laptop. One of the things I love about the headset I use most often is that it has a built in mute switch.\nI like the mute switch on my headset because it is a physical switch that I can use to mute my microphone quickly and easily. I can find and discretely flip this switch without looking at it, and I can tell just by touching it whether I am muted or not, it is really convenient.\nOn occasion I use an actual microphone for video calls and the device that the microphone plugs in to has a gain knob which is convenient for the same reasons as that mute switch:\nAs much as I like being able to turn on and off my mic this way, in certain contexts I’ve gone back to using the software mute button in Google Meet / Zoom / whichevervideoplatform. I’ve done this because I believe that the built in visible mute indicator built in to all these video platforms has started to become a form of non-verbal communication.\nI’ve been a part of more than one video call where Person A is doing most of the talking in a meeting while Person B and Person C are muted. Suddenly Person B clicks that unmute button, the\ndisappears, and Person A stops talking and says something to the effect of “Person B, do you have something to add?”\nThis might sound unremarkable, but it is particularly interesting to me because of how many social cues don’t work, or are hard/impossible to notice over video calls. In a face to face conversation, body language, taking a breath, facial expressions, or any number of other non-verbal cues might indicate that someone would like to speak. We make due without these on video calls, but this is one tool that we have on video calls that we don’t have in person.\nI think I might need to give up my physical mute switch and get used to hauling my cursor across the screen and over to the toolbar and clicking that mute button.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nContext Collapse and Reintegrating with the Matrix…\nNext Post\nMoral Transformation and Digital Identity\n(2) Comments\nJennifer Nissen\nJune 9, 2020 at 2:13 pm\nReply\nTaylor, thanks for the great tips!

Between the readings, conversations on Slack, video calls, and blogs, this experience pushed me to get outside of my comfort zone and has changed the way I interact with my students both inside and outside of the classroom significantly. I’ll be taking you through my #DigPINS journey and showing you how I incorporated what I learned into my classroom project!\nWeek 1: Who am I, really?\nThis week focused on Digital Identity and immediately got me thinking about who “I am” and what that really means. We dissected our online identities and created a visual that helped us pinpoint what online spaces we frequent and our participation in these spaces. This week really made me think about the importance of a digital identity and for whom is it most important. I started thinking about how all of my students have digital identities, and I wanted to find a way to tap into those identities, which I will discuss below when I address the project I had students do throughout this Spring semester.\nWeek 2: To interact or not to interact??\nThis week focused on Digital Networks and challenged us to think critically about who we interact with online. Social networks are everywhere and somewhat unavoidable. What this week made me realize the most is how digital networks change based on an individual’s needs at any given time. This week got my wheels turning and wondering what type of interactions were my students having online? Were they all just superficial and did their networks mainly consist of the Instagram, snapchat, and twitter spheres? How many of them were engaging with networks online for some type of positive change? Aha! This was my aha moment when my project—although I had already proposed one—became more clear. Stay tuned for more details on that below!\nWeek 3: Learning from a Disaster\nDuring week 3 we focused on Digital Pedagogy which basically required me to relive my first digital project that was slightly disastrous. I leapt before testing the waters and was overwhelmed by just how much work digital pedagogy entailed. I learned that I should go to  the experts to learn more about how to incorporate digital projects into my classrooms and received a lot of support from the IT department at SNC. Thanks, everyone!\nWeek 4: The Scholarship Dilemma\nThis week focused on Digital Scholarship, which I spend a lot of time thinking about as a tenure track faculty member who needs to disseminate their scholarship. I want to have a broader reach and create scholarship that impacts the people that it is relevant to, not just other academics. This got my wheels spinning, once again. I decided that I wanted to create an online space for students to develop scholarship that would reach beyond academia and would be accessible to those who need it!\nMy project:\nMy overall\ninitial\nproposal focused on integrating a digital component to my courses. I slightly steered away from my original plan, and developed a project that students could connect with slightly more than the initial project. Basically, I had students in my Social Work Practice: Organizations, Communities, and Institutions class develop an online blog that would give them the space to assess, identity, and thoroughly plan out an opportunity for change in the community that they are from. This was a three-part blog assignment that students worked on throughout the semester.\nThe first blog was asked students to do some research on their community and assess it thoroughly, the second stage asked them to identify the needs of their community and the ways in which other communities have created change around similar needs, and the last stage required them to develop an in-depth intervention plan that would improve their community. I altered my original project because I wanted to create a project that drew on some of the topics that we discussed during the 4 weeks of DigPINS. I wanted students to think about their digital identity, move beyond the typical social networks that this generation typically uses, and create scholarship that is accessible for everyone. I also wanted students to be committed to the project and feel like they were producing something more than just a paper for me.\nBecause I wanted to tap into my students’ digital identities, I required all of them to post a picture of themselves on their website. This was a way for them to take ownership of the content of their website and have their posts be a reflection of who they are.\nThe first post was due in early March and the last post was due in early April. Each blog built on the previous blog and were housed in the same website so students, as well as I, could easily see their growth and progress. I couldn’t have expected the types of blogs that I received. We actually worked on the first post in class a few times so that students could check in with me and run ideas by one another. The level of attention to detail, the creativity, and the overall engagement in this project was amazing! I really think that the reason students were so into this project is because it drew on their skills and what they enjoy doing – being online. There was a visual component that traditional papers don’t allow for. There was also a deeply personal component. They also had the option to embed videos, which many did, to give further background on their community’s needs. It allowed for the reader to SEE the need. The digital component truly changed everything and even made the grading process quite entertaining!\nWhile many of the students originally struggled with formatting and working with WordPress, they frequented the Service Desk repeatedly and truly learned how to navigate the site. They learned about design thinking through their effort to place images, videos, and text in a way that portrayed exactly what they wanted to. They learned about digital survival skills, as the projects asked them to conduct research and engage in the literature. Lastly, they learned about data analysis and presentation, as they had to determine what they would report based on their analysis of their community needs.\nStudents goals were assessed by me using a checklist. Students were given the checklist of what should be included in the blog in advance. I found that most students included everything that was asked of them and there was no confusion, unlike written assignments.\nNext Steps:\nI would like to stay in contact with this first cohort of students and see if any of them are interested in disseminating their blogs to people in their community. There are some extremely creative plans for change that are ready to go with the right support. I plan to also get feedback from students to see what worked and what could be improved moving forward. This will help with future digital projects that I will develop for other classes.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nDomains of One’s Own… it’s just a website right?\nNext Post\nReflecting on Teaching Illustration Online\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\nWrite a Comment...\nEmail (Required)\nName (Required)\nWebsite\nLoading Comments...\nComment\n×\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

I am very much out of my comfort zone when blogging so bear with me. Writing does not come very naturally to me, but I wanted to challenge myself with this. Enjoy my thoughts about week one!\nI am excited to explore Twitter. Up until now, I’ve had a personal account that I occasionally tweet on, but I have not thought of Twitter as a place to connect for pedagogy. I’m interested in discovering this side of Twitter. The handout by Laura Gogia also made me realize I’ve been using Twitter incorrectly. Instead of checking Twitter periodically throughout the day, I check it maybe once of week which is probably why I haven’t gotten the most out of my Twitter experience.\nI found the Visitor-Resident map very interesting to create. What I found surprising is how many digital resources I regularly use. I was happy to see that I am more of a visitor on most sites versus a resident. I would prefer to leave a smaller footprint on the website versus a larger one.\nMy personal VR map\nWhen I was watching the videos on mapping, it bothered me that David White kept referring to resident as the one that leaves a footprint after you log off and visitor does not. I understand what he meant by that, but it is important to note that everything we do on the website leaves a footprint whether we like it or not. One example of this is when we get ads of something we have recently searched. This data might not be visible to the general public, but it is visible to a few. What we do on the web is always somewhat trackable.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nWeek 1: complex digital identity\nNext Post\nThe Reluctant Self-Promoter\n(4) Comments\nAndrew\nJune 27, 2019 at 3:34 pm\nReply\nAnnicka, your words about the footprint we leave is very insightful.\nMy map looks like a few cacti in the dessert\nbut I realize, after seeing yours, that it probably is more of a forest than I thought.\nSusan Ashley\nJune 27, 2019 at 5:36 pm\nReply\nAnnicka,\nNice Map!  This shows where you stand at this point in your life and your relationship with technology.  I found it interesting that you feel you were using Twitter wrong.  I think we all make choices on how we use our social media sites, so it will be interesting to see how you feel about changing your Twitter “checking” to a more active role.\nAutumm Caines\nJune 30, 2019 at 12:04 am\nReply\n“What we do on the web is always somewhat trackable”\nThis is an important point you make here Annicka. It is easy to forget sometimes that the V&R mapping process was created back in 2011 – While we knew back then that the tools on the web were tracking us people did not give it as much thought and there was much more trust in these tools. In recent years we have come to see what is possible with all of these data and that there are implications on both an individual level and societal level.\nShan Bryan-Hanson\nJuly 8, 2019 at 4:07 pm\nReply\nGreat drawing!

Maybe it will speak to others like me. Individuals\nwho roll their eyes at whatever new social media trend there is, people that\nscoff at blogs or vlogs, folks that grumble and mumble about millennials and\ntheir internet this-or-that. It all began with #DigPINS, some summer activity I\nthought would advance my teaching agenda. I still grumble about Twitter and\nother forms of social media but more importantly, I found myself connected to a\nnetwork of likeminded people (who are probably a little less curmudgeonly) with\na wide range of skills and interests in digital learning and pedagogy.\nI left #DigPINS and started the fall semester, a new course,\na global seminar– African Wildlife Conservation and Health. I had all of sorts\nof ideas bouncing around in the back of my head, things about digital literacy,\ndomains, and scholarship. I had no real intent of implementing any of those\nconcepts into my new course, until part way through the semester when a\ncolleague used the term “\ndisposable\nassignments\n.” I have assigned plenty of research papers over the years but\nnever considered that students did all of that work and I would be the only\nother person to ever see the product. This new course was meant to provide\nstudents with an opportunity to dive deep into some aspect of African wildlife\nthat would allow them to explore an area meaningful to them. This was the\nperfect place to utilize elements of open pedagogy and create something each\nclass could learn from and build on.\nA webpage! Or web based something? I could have students\nbuild their own sites and link them all together. I wasn’t off to a very good\nstart. I know some HTML, I was sure I could cobble together some assignment and\nget students doing more with the digital tools that were out there.\nMy lab website\nis\nhosted on Google Sites and every student at SNC has a Google account so this\ncould work? Everyone seems to be using WordPress these days, so maybe I should\nswitch to that, and what’s this Domain of One’s Own? So using this newly found\nnetwork I asked these questions. Actually what I asked was “Why use a\nDomain of\nOne’s Own\n… it’s just a website right?” The short answer is no, it isn’t\njust a website and be careful who you pose this question to or you’ll get quite\nthe earful. What I didn’t realize is that with Google Sites you get a very\nlimited webpage building tool, and with Domains you get access to all of the\nelements that allow you to develop nearly anything web based (within reason).\nYou have back door access to a platform with tools that could let you build a\nsimple web page, or an interactive site to collect data and run simulations, or\nperhaps deploy an app. You are really only limited by your own creative and\ntechnological abilities.\nThe Brandt Lab website created with Google Sites.\nReflection\nExploring the domains project, I was direct to\nKnight Domains\n. This is St. Norbert\nCollege’s initiative\n“that empowers\nstudents, faculty, and staff to take responsibility for a little piece of the\ninternet that they can call their own.”\nI explored the different tools\navailable attempting to find something that I could use for my course.\nWordPress\n(a blogging application) came\nhighly recommended and there are many\nexamples\nof other faculty using this tool. In case you missed my earlier grumblings, I\nwas not about to start blogging for my class (pay no attention to my current\nactions). In searching through the many other non-WordPress tools I came upon\ndokuwiki\n, an open source wiki\npublishing tool. This! This is what I needed to create some lasting and\nmeaningful assignment for my students. The basics of this tool is that I create\na\nsub-domain\nwithin my\nmain Knight Domain to host the wiki site and give it some sort of frame work\nthat the students can then build onto. For this course, I wanted students to be\nable to pick a topic, thoroughly research the subject, and create an informational\nwiki page\nakin to those on\nWikipedia\n.\nHomepage of the dokuwiki site at\nhttp://southafrica.adambrandt.knight.domains\nI was prepared for an uphill battle with my students.\nSometimes getting them to turn in an assignment as a PDF is a challenge and now\nI’m asking them to be creative, use a new\nsyntax\n,\nand develop something that could be seen by anyone. The fact that they struggle\nwith what should be simple digital skills is all the more reason to throw them\nhead first into this project. There was some guidance, sticking with the\ndigital theme I created a\ntutorial video\nto show them exactly how to get going on the project (I recommend playing at ½\nspeed unless you can easily follow what an auctioneer says – I talk really\nfast). Nonetheless, as students worked through this project they had the\nopportunity to build skills in two areas of\ndigital\ncompetencies\n.\nYouTube video tutorial on how to build content on the docuwiki platform.\nDigital\nSurvival Skills\n. Despite students growing up with ready access to computers\nor other devices, I find it surprising that this area remains a major challenge\nfor students. With such an open ended assignment and a novel platform, there\nare countless ways for things to go wrong. As students attempted to create or\nedit pages, some accidentally deleted parts of the site. Others would modify an\nimage only to crash the overall formatting. While the content was important,\nthe lesson focused more on learning how to\ntroubleshoot\ndigital problems. Once they managed to stop accidentally deleting things, they\nmoved into\nmetacognition\nand life-long learning\n. They were out of their element and they knew it.\nAfter I assured them that they couldn’t permanently hurt anything and after\nshowing them how to quickly resurrect deleted pages, they began identifying their\nown strength and weaknesses. I was expecting them to complete this project and\na grade was at stake, this was the true motivator. If they were to succeed they\nneeded to learn techniques for adding images, incorporating citations, and\nbetter understand the different dokuwiki tools. If they were going to finish\nthe project with a high grade they needed to find ways to improve their skills\nbeyond asking me how to do everything. The students spent more time reading the\ndocumentation, searching for solutions on the web, and even finding unique workarounds.\nDigital\nCommunication.\nSpecific to this competency were lessons in\ndigital\nwriting and publishing\n. Students had the opportunity to choose between\nusing the native dokuwiki syntax or a rich text editor wrapper. Spoiler alert\nthey chose the latter. Nevertheless, there were times when even the editor\ncaused problems and students needed to parse the syntax to get the page to\nappear as they desired. For most this was the first experience with any sort of\nprogramming language. They may not be experts at it, but now they know how to do\nsome basic level coding and they can use this knowledge on something like that reliable\nbut ancient piece of equipment every lab seems to have still running MS DOS.\nDigital Competencies. Image credit Bryn Mawr College\nConclusion\nAll in all, the first pass at this project didn’t take too long to\nprepare or implement. I spent some time doing some behind the scenes work and\ntidying up the site, but the end result is a good start. Eight really\nwell-crafted pages on topics relating to African wildlife conservation and\nhealth etched into a corner of the web that will remain for some time. At the\nvery least my current students learned some new tools and hopefully some skills\nthat will benefit them in the future. In the next iteration of the course,\nstudents will have the opportunity to learn from what was done and further build\non this growing body of knowledge.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\n21st Century Digital Scholarship\nNext Post\nMy #DigPINS experience\n(2) Comments\nReid Riggle\nMay 1, 2019 at 12:00 pm\nReply\nThanks for having the courage to consider and explore new ideas that can elevate student learning, Adam.

Lately, I have been thinking about how what I consume on the web affects me, or how my “online” self affects my “offline” self.\nI have always enjoyed reading news articles and blog posts on the internet. I’ve made a habit of frequently reading blogs and news sites on various topics that interest me (mostly tech, education and music) since high school. For me this behavior has not changed,\nI still read a lot of articles and blog posts, but the\nway\nI consume the majority of my written content on the web\nhas\nchanged.\nGood ol’ bookmarks\nFirefox 1.5, with glorious tabbed browsing. A blast from the past.\nSource\nI used to simply have a folder of bookmarks that I would visit (one at a time) when I was looking for something to read. Eventually I was able to use browser tabs to make it easy to open multiple sites at once!\nGoogle Reader (and RSS!)\nSource\nThen I discovered\nGoogle Reader\n, an RSS reader, which allows you to subscribe to posts from your favorite sites and have them delivered to you in an inbox of sorts. This was great because it allowed me to subscribe to a much wider variety of sources to read and it even worked pretty well on my iPod Touch.\n1st gen iPod Touch. More nostalgia.\nSource\nGoogle Reader was a cool service at the time, but I had some problems with my own usage of RSS. I began to treat it like work. It felt like I had to at least skim each and every article that came through to zero out my inbox of articles. This type of thinking caused me to abandon the idea of using Google Reader or other RSS readers and instead I transitioned my reading back to just visiting sites by typing them into the address bar of my browser.\nThe Problem\nSource\nSoon, as social media platforms became more popular I began to find myself spending more time there and transitioning more of my reading time away from individual sites. Jumping forward to about 6 months ago I realized that I was seeking out way less individual news sources than I ever had and instead spent most of my reading time on Twitter, Facebook and Reddit. I noticed that the news sites I did intentionally visit were whittled down to only a few because it was easier to just visit Twitter and Reddit.\nThis all makes sense. Platforms like these live and die on their ability to keep people engaged. The business models of these sites are based around getting you to spend more time on them, so that you view and engage with advertisements they get paid to display. These sites are engineered to make you want to visit them as often as possible and for you to feel like there is always more to discover on them.\nWhy does it matter?\nThe media I consume online is certainly one of the ingredients that make up my persona. At the risk of sounding dramatic, why wouldn’t I want to have control over that part of what makes me, me? That being said, I know that I don’t want to just stop reading articles and blog posts, so I needed something else to shift those habits over to.\n1\nTiny Tiny RSS\nTiny Tiny RSS hosted on my domain at reader.jadin.me\nThis is where RSS readers (remember Google Reader?) come back in to importance for me. Unfortunately Google Reader has been\ndiscontinued since 2013\nso I started my search for something to replace it. I tried several platforms like\nFeedly\n,\nInoreader\n, and\nNewsBlur\n. While these RSS readers mostly worked how I’d like them to\n2\nI felt as long as I was going to take ownership over what I read, I should take ownership of the tool I would use to do my reading as well. For me this meant that I should go with something that I could host on my own domain.\nAfter some more research I decided on Tiny Tiny RSS, which I set up with my favorite blogs and news sources at\nreader.jadin.me\n. After some tinkering I got everything working the way I like AND I solved my problem with feeling stressed out by the number of unread items using this thought technology:\n3\nI don’t need to read everything in my RSS reader. It is both OK and totally healthy to hit the “Mark as Read” button on occasion.\nIts stupid that I couldn’t come to terms with this earlier, but thats sometimes how my brain works.\n4\nAnother tactic that helps me here is to organize the larger news sites and smaller blogs into their own respective categories. This makes it easier to simply skim the headlines of the news websites while still catching every post from blogs I really care about.\nFinal Thoughts\nHas this been successful? So far, I think so. I definitely spend much more of my reading time in Tiny Tiny RSS, which I have set up with a much more diverse set of news sources and blogs and its usually the first place I will go when I’m looking for something to read.

I was teaching a class, had developed a nice curriculum which seemed to resonate with a fair number of my students. And it was actually helping to keep students on campus – Retention – YES! Despite all of this, I was quite hesitant about actually writing a book. I know quite a bit about career exploration, and I love doing research, as nerdy as that sounds. But writing a book? I wasn’t sure.\nAs it turned out, I went to a conference and ended up talking with a guy who was a new author in career development. As it also turned out, we were at a wine tasting event with a really fun group of people, we became fast friends and shared lots of laughs and stories. Later, a group of us were hanging around a campfire and (after a glass or two of wine) I began talking about this proposal I had gotten to write this book. I expressed my doubts about my skill level, knowledge level, grammar level, basically everything. He patiently heard me out, then said to me, “Sheila, you know who the people are that write books? They aren’t always the smartest, the funniest, or most eloquent. The people who write books, are the people who actually sit down and write the d**n book!”\nThat was the best advice I could have gotten at the time I most needed it. I realized what he was saying; we don’t have to be the top experts in our field in order to publish something. If we have knowledge we wish to share, put it out there. There might be someone out there who benefits from our knowledge, or adds to it, or corrects it. I realized that maybe I had a way of sharing some career knowledge that just might touch someone in a way that could help them. I just had to try. So I did. It was an arduous experience. I learned quite a bit. I’m sure my 2nd edition will be MUCH better than what’s currently out there. It’s not perfect, but you know what? I’m the d**n author.\nMy point is, knowledge and research is great. But to me, it doesn’t matter unless I can share it with someone. My field requires me to develop a large hypothetical toolbox with with to help people. Different tools help different people in different ways. I have enjoyed learning about #DigPINS because it has enabled me to learn about new technology plus how I can take the knowledge I have, imperfect though it may be, and help others in new ways. And that allows me to gain continual career enjoyment.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nTeaching the Teachers\nNext Post\nCh-ch-ch-ch-changes\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\nWrite a Comment...\nEmail (Required)\nName (Required)\nWebsite\nLoading Comments...\nComment\n×\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

I want one of those: The Library’s role in OER – SNC #DigPINS","text":"Home\n>\nBlog\n>\nPedagogy\n>\nHey! I want one of those: The Library’s role in OER\nWhen participating in DigPins was originally pitched to me, I had some hesitations. See, I’m one of those librarians that has carefully guided their career to avoid the inside of a classroom—we exist mostly on the collection/tech side of libraries.  Despite avoiding the classroom, I have become interested in what is going on in the classroom, especially around OER, textbook affordability, and library resources.  While we have focused on the beneficial partnership between open pedagogy and OER, I thinks it is also important to dig into what might be the first step of this process for many—finding and adopting an OER.\nFinding an OER you want to use is often the most difficult step of the process. In fact, for three straight years in a\nsurvey on OER in US higher ed.\nfaculty members have reported it as the biggest barrier to adoption.\nLibraries and librarians are playing a key role in OER discovery by assisting with the development of platforms like the\nOpen Textbook Library\nand by becoming participating members in the\nOpen Textbook Network.\nLibrarians are also serving as curators of OER resource lists for their campuses—\nUW-Milwaukee\nand\nNC State\n– and by preserving and storing OERs in library managed institutional repositories. By placing OERs in institutional repositories, they are preserved locally and easily discoverable by local users with existing library search tools and broader user when institutional repositories are indexed and made discoverable via Google Scholar.\nWith some librarian meta-data and discovery know how, librarians are also creating homegrown solutions to search across the various platforms that contain OER materials. While not perfect, these sort of discovery interfaces take direct aim at the major barrier to adopting OER and bring in results from the various platforms that house OER materials in hopes of providing users with an easier discovery experience.  One example of this is\nGeorge Mason’s Metafinder tool.\nI know this deviates a bit from what’s at the heart of our discussion on open pedagogy and OER but my favorite example of libraries connecting users to alternatives for traditional textbooks–and a great example of the direction that textbook affordability will go until OER are more widely adopted–is what the University of South Florida Library is doing to push faculty members toward easily adopting\nE-books for the classroom\n.  (Disclaimer: The search within this platform provides results for both OER textbooks from the Open Textbook Library and Library e-books that are not available via open licensing. While not open like OER, Library e-books can be adopted by faculty and used at no cost to the student–well, the library pays for them but we have always said that our collections are based on the curriculum). From this one simple search platform, faculty members can identify relevant materials, adopt them for the classroom and get the necessary links to embed the materials in a syllabus and/or their course management system.  Pretty dope. Here is a look.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nReflections on Synchronicity and Week 3 DigPINS Sync Activities\nNext Post\nBut I thought geography was just about maps?!\n(2) Comments\nReid Riggle\nJuly 13, 2018 at 5:17 pm\nReply\nGreat post, Mitchell.

A few interesting readings, a visitor resident map, slack discussions, and finally putting off my blog post until I have had a chance to see how the crowd was positioned before I shouted my thoughts into cyberspace. In real life… sorry IRL I enjoy the quiet and I would much rather spend my time with a few friends having a drink on the back porch or in some wilderness far from civilization. When planning a vacation big cities are on the bottom of the list – I grew up a short drive from DC, Pittsburgh, and Baltimore yet visited all of them collectively less than a dozen times. I think this identity translates well to my digital identity and explains most of my online habits. Any time I begin to engage in any form of social media I almost immediately become this guy:\nMost of the internet I am a visitor. Any place I am a resident is focused on interacting with that small group of friends and family or to promote myself professionally. I seek places on the web where I can accomplish a task without much interaction with others. Just as I get overwhelmed in a city with all the noise, hustle, and bustle, I find find some digital environments to be the same so I avoid them. So now week 1 is done and it is time to get introspective. Who am I online and what does this mean for pedagogy? My digital identity is more or less a hermit, I come out now and then to be reminded about what I am missing then I retreat to my cave (credit to Mitchell Scott’s much better prairie dog analogy). I use digital tools necessary to accomplish my research or teaching. As an instructor or collaborator, I need to consider other’s digital identity to be effective in my teaching and research. I might prefer the quiet, but every now and then you need to venture into the city.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nEmbracing the Digital Game\nNext Post\nZone of proximal development\n(2) Comments\nautumm\nJune 27, 2018 at 3:01 am\nReply\nThanks for this reflection Adam. Though you describe yourself as leaning more visitor I think you have the great makings of a resident if you so desire.  One thing that drives me nuts about a lot of resident activity is that much of it can be sort of thoughtless. Being resident is not about pushing content it is about creating meaningful connections with content and with other people.\nEven if you decide that being resident in public is not for you I think that the skills and tools of residency would serve you well in making connections with your students.\nNice gif use btw\nShan Bryan-Hanson\nJune 28, 2018 at 4:28 pm\nReply\n” I enjoy the quiet and I would much rather spend my time with a few friends having a drink on the back porch or in some wilderness far from civilization.”   I relate to the need for quiet spaces.

It also sounds similar to the peer instruction model. So there are a lot of folks out there who are having good results with team approaches to testing!\nIt’s neat to connect it to Vygotsky! It’s been long enough since I looked at that model that I tend to think of it as a personal zone, but of course that personal readiness to learn new things would be impacted by social relationships and support.\nReid\nJune 28, 2018 at 2:55 pm\nReply\nZPD is a very flexible concept.

And reading about Sarah’s evolution in becoming her authentic awesome self, I relate to that as well. I hopped on line to social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc. to keep up with my students, and my own children. But stayed online and connected for me. In many ways, connecting with old friends and family on social media helped me form a bond with them I would not have otherwise had. My cousins are spread throughout the US, so Facebook was a way to connect with all of them, AND we actually got my grandma on for a bit, which she found perplexing, but enjoyable (mainly, she would go on Facebook to chide us for not calling her enough). Then I started connecting with high school classmates, wow. Social constructs that existed in high school suddenly disappeared, and I had meaningful conversations with members of my class that deepened into true friendships irl. That would NOT have happened without social media.\nAnother cool thing happened to me as I searched the internet and ventured into social media: I found my authentic self. I found that my opinion was valid and valued in public forums, not just among my family and friends. This gave me increased confidence. I found a way to express who I am professionally as well, I created classes for older dislocated workers who needed to learn to go online and look for jobs. Then I created an online class, which turned into a book, and so on. So while many people venture cautiously on to social platforms, and caution is warranted to a certain extent, I journey forward into new technology with a sense of enthusiasm. I have enjoyed my time online and have discovered so many new abilities. I’ve also uncovered some mad skills in my social media game that have helped take my self confidence to fun new levels. So bring on the new technology! I’ll probably flail around a bit, but eventually I’ll get it.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nIn praise of idleness…kind of\nNext Post\nDigital Hermit\n(2) Comments\nSarah\nJune 26, 2018 at 3:55 pm\nReply\nGreat post!

I’m exhausted just thinking about it and it makes me quite comfortable in my current state of digital idleness.  But, breaking out of our comfort zone and trying something new is usually a good thing and maybe Stewart is right that the only path forward, with the help of DigPins, is through.\nFor myself, I can see this process playing out the same way as when I started running for exercise.  At first, a ½ mile is going to be terrible and require what seems like way too much effort for the short distance traveled. But eventually, less effort will be required (right?) and terrible might actually give way to some form of enjoyment from the process (maybe?).  That is my hope at least and at the end of this experience if no form of digital residency is appealing then I can retreat back to digital observer, visitor and consumer.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nPublish What?\nNext Post\nEmbracing the Digital Game\n(1) Comment\nautumm\nJune 27, 2018 at 2:50 am\nReply\nHey Mitchell,\nThanks for this post.

In its purest sense I think that many consider synchronous or simultaneous to mean something occurring in this one moment. But what about duration? And what about other things that can happen during that duration?\nI don’t want to wax philosophic about the nature of time too much here (Quick!!! Is there a physicist in the house!). I’m thinking about all of this because we have a couple of “synchronous” activities for this week in DigPINS that I am excited about and one of them is over a two day period which may not seem so synchronous to some.  I think it is the best kind of synchronous because there is lots of time in-between to think and connect and we don’t have to make arrangements to all be at the same moment. It is just so much more flexible and inclusive. Don’t get me wrong I love the other kind too – that in the moment real-time connection. They are different but I still think that they can be synchronous – I wonder if synchronous can be on a spectrum?\nThis is also the point in DigPINS where things start to open up even more and so I wanted to write a post about these ‘events’ to invite others who may want to join.\nWed & Thurs, July 11th & 12th – Annotation of But You Can’t Do That in a STEM course\nOur first synchronous activity for the week starts on Wednesday the 11th and it involves using Hypothesis to annotate this Hybrid Pedagogy article\nBut You Can’t Do That in a STEM Course\n. Over these two days we will do a deep read of this article through annotation. We are annotating in the public so feel free to jump in with your thoughts and questions.\nIf you have never used Hypothesis before you will need an account and you can either use the link above or install a browser extension. I made a video last year that shows some basics of using Hypothesis but if you are struggling with what to say and how to use the tool creatively check out Hypothesis Educations’\nAnnotation Tips for Students\n. Though written for classroom students I think it does a nice job of giving some tips.\nThe other day it was super fun to see\nRemi Kalir,\nAssistant Professor of Information and Learning Technologies from Colorado University, Denver, pop into the #DigPINS tag on twitter to show us the\nCROWDLAAERS\ntool that they have built out of the\nMarginal Syllabus project\n. So check this out – just pop in the Hypothesis link to the article that we are annotating and see all the stats for that article.\nFriday, July 13th at 1:30pm CDT and 2:30pm EDT – Live stream and recorded video call with Barron Koralesky\nThis is what most folks think of as a synchronous activity. There is an exact time that everyone meets during and the duration is generally pretty short – an hour or so. I love these kind of events especially when they are rich media like video where you can see everyone’s expressions and such – I do a lot of them through\nVirtually Connecting\n.\nI’m super excited that this week we will be speaking with Barron Koralesky on a live video call that will be live streamed and recorded. Barron is the Chief Information Officer at Williams College in Massachusetts. Prior to that, Barron was the Director of Client Services and Academic Technology at Macalester College. Cross-institutional learning and collaboration has been key to Barron’s approach to his profession and he’ll join us to talk about forming and nurturing these networks.\nI’m thrilled to help organize these events and to be able to take part in them. I do hope that if you are part of one of our DigPINS cohorts that you will be able to jump in but even if you are an educator from another institution who is interested in these topics that you will think about joining us.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nInterdisciplinary Digital Pedagogies\nNext Post\nHey!

Specifically, the idea of our Public Learning Network (PLN). Despite a robust appetite for talking with strangers and for broadcasting minutiae to social media, the idea of “networking” makes me weary. I imagined networking in the context of late 20\nth\ncentury corporate culture: putting on a power suit, schmoozing, and assessing people in transactional terms. Tonight, I read something that helped me recognize how silly and narrow that idea is.\nThe transformative text came from the introduction to adrienne maree brown’s book\nEmergent Strategy: Shaping Change, Changing Worlds\n. In her poetic, free flowing introduction, brown talked about the path and people that led her to learn about “emergent strategy” and to write the book. She named some of the women who were her teachers and mentors and discussed their work. Chief among them\nMargaret Wheatley\n,\nGrace Lee Boggs\n, and\nOctavia Butler.\nIt was in brown’s discussion of Wheatley’s work (as introduced to her by Boggs) and the focus on “critical connections instead of critical mass” that spoke to me. In her book\nLeadership and the New Science\n, Wheatley introduces ideas of what brown describes as “biomimicry and mushroom magic.” These words sparked in me a vision of bright* mycelium, branching and connecting through dark soil, building a resilient web of slender threads: a network that feeds and nourishes not only the fungal body but also the other species surrounding it. Much of our culture seems to be rooted (pun intended) in a mindset of scarcity and competition. This idea of mycelial growth moves me: networks as born of and generating abundance rather than scarcity. brown describes it succinctly: Relationships are everything.\nMycelium\nby\nKirill Ignatyev\nis licensed under (\nCC BY-NC 2.0\n).\nTo bring it back to #DigPINS, I’ve struggled with the question of who makes up my PLN or, in the absence of such a cluster, who would I like to have in it and how I’d reach them? When I consider a PLN as the intellectual (and possibly spiritual) equivalent of mycelial growth that might lead to visible fruit (fungi, y’all!), I start to get a clearer sense of who and what I’m looking for. Also helpful, this metaphor helps me frame how I might approach people in and around my field in a spirit of abundance and critical connections rather than with the mindset of competition and scarcity. The “declaration” of Bonnie Stewart’s steps for getting started in a network.\nTo go one step further, and take a stab at\nJoe’s suggestion to write until you know what you’ll write about next\n: I’m excited to explore the vision of “mushroom magic” as it might pertain to and strengthen the culture of an online classroom.\n* – Before anyone comments to tell me that mycelium are not bright because they’re underground: it’s a vision, let’s allow for a little poetic license in the telling.\nletterpress terrarium\nby\nkt.ries\nis licensed under (\nCC BY-NC 2.0\n).\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nZone of proximal development\nNext Post\nEntering the Labyrinth\n(3) Comments\nReid\nJune 28, 2018 at 2:48 pm\nReply\nI appreciate the imagery and the “positive flip” in your thinking.\nShan Bryan-Hanson\nJune 28, 2018 at 4:20 pm\nReply\nLove this–“These words sparked in me a vision of bright* mycelium, branching and connecting through dark soil, building a resilient web of slender threads: a network that feeds and nourishes not only the fungal body but also the other species surrounding it.

I’ve got an app for my desktop and one for my phone as well.\nJennifer\nJuly 6, 2018 at 2:43 am\nReply\nI use a similar technique called “speed dating your tasks”:\nhttps://www.quickanddirtytips.com/productivity/organization/stop-procrastinating-by-speed-dating-your-tasks\nI certainly couldn’t sustain this level of work all day, every day but it works when I have 8-10 things hanging over my head that need to get done.  I make a list of the items and then, work on each for 5 minutes.  Then, if I complete them in 5 minutes, I cross them off the list.  If not, I move on to the next one.  The creator of this method suggests 10 minutes on each task in the second round but that feels to long so I normally increase to 7 minutes and then, 10 minutes on the third round.\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

It is fun to look at the larger trends and think about how we fit or don’t fit into them and I do think that the larger studies that are based on age can be of value for reflecting sociologically. I do worry, however, that too often we let these “trends” define us or define others around us.\nThe end of the PEW report that you posted on Millennials states it best\n“We look forward to spending the next few years studying this generation as it enters adulthood. All the while, we’ll keep in mind that generations are a lens through which to understand societal change, rather than a label with which to oversimplify differences between groups.”\nThanks for this post!\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\nWrite a Comment...\nEmail (Required)\nName (Required)\nWebsite\nLoading Comments...\nComment\n×\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

At the time, I thought it was callous and overly formal, but I’ve come around to see the wisdom in being careful with your “indelible” words. As someone who is quick to speak and favors the irreverent and flippant, writing and anticipating an audience is a helpful check. What works in speech, especially face-to-face, doesn’t always translate in writing. [Interesting side note: the college friend went on to become a writer and has just published her first novel,\nAlternative Remedies for Loss\n.]\nSarah wrote earlier today\nabout the challenge of representing oneself clearly and authentically, especially with those whom we lack the foundation of face-to-face time, what she called “bigger context of who [we are].” I’m thinking about a version of that challenge as I head into teaching my first online course: how to build authentic and meaningful relationships digitally without being able to “read the room” in the way I can with a traditional class. My goal in public writing is a voice that is engaging and authentic, but I’m wondering already if positioning writing as the primary means of meeting and getting to know one another is too limited and static.\nAutumm and Joe have set a good tone\nand inspired me with the mix of synchronous and asynchronous interactions for DigPINs. I’m looking forward to taking notes and learning from you all. Also, if you have any specific pointers for building community online, please send them my way.\n//\nImage is “Dec. 22, 2015″ by artist Fred Tomaselli.

Thanks for passing it on. One of my specific concerns is that this is an illustration course.. Were I teaching it in the studio, we’d have a lot of demos and in-class work days. It is a 300-level course, so I think it’s ok to expect students to work more outside of class, but I’m nervous about losing those points of contact mid-way.

This problem is exaggerated online and it can lead to many problems. I rarely share articles or information online, but, I will ask people and they will look at me a bit different. They have said, “Cassie, you know that’s not real, right?” I always like to see the good in people and trust them, but online that is a real problem.\nAmy Collier’s talk about trusting people online really has made me reevaluate how I am looking at news online. One of the many tips I will use in the future is seeing if more than one source is covering a story. I also want to get in the habit of checking what site the story is on and reading the comments to see what other people feel.\nRecently, there has been a post going around Facebook and Twitter about the freezing temperatures and the homeless in Chicago. The post claims that at least 15 people have died in the cold on Chicago streets, and features a picture of a person seeming to be freezing on the side of the street. I believed right away, as I usually do, but this time I thought about it for a minute. I had never seen this story anywhere else, and I felt like it would have been broadcasted more. I Googled the story and did not see any other results and was very skeptical and later found out it was fake.\nTaking a second to think about if an article could be fake and not always trusting everything is a something I am trying to learn. Going forward, I hope that I think before I become angry or before I share and make not trust everything I see online.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nDigital Pedagogy\nNext Post\nMy Journey with #digPINS\n(2) Comments\nCristina Ortiz\nFebruary 1, 2019 at 2:06 am\nReply\nFake news!!!!

It’s exciting to be able to collaborate on this platform and create a digital id! Mapping out my digital identification for digPINS made me realize that I’ve been most invested on creating a professional id, whether that is as resident or visitor. Some of the key points that stand out from my own VR-map which I’d like to comment on at this time are the following two: 1) Blogging is an entirely new experience for me. I didn’t think of creating a blog before. Perhaps one of the reasons is my own mis/understanding of the time needed to keep a blog. I knew that digPINS requires one and I’m willing (and definitely ready!) to get out of my comfort zone to explore this new component of an online id. And 2) My dig. id as a “resident-professional” has lately been working on research publications; more specifically, working on articles and in a more carefully-planned timeline has been my book-length manuscript for the past two-and-a-half years (in addition to teaching, of course). This entails keeping a very active mode of engagement in sharing my work with reviewers/editors in Google docs. In addition, this summer in particular, I’ve been fully engaged with the e.Proofing system, which is a new online editing tool for me. It’s been gratifying to have been able to edit my book using e.Proofing. I’ve been able to remotely correct my work, which makes the editing process so much faster.

More than ever, my teaching and research benefit from connections created in social technologies. Information is rapidly accessible online, therefore, it’s easy to keep oneself updated on the latest research or pedagogy. I maintain a digital identity and connection with colleagues at other institutions and even have one of my favorite authors as a friend on social media. However, this accessibility can also be risky. Sharing personal or professional perspectives may impact the way others interpret your digital identity.\nMoreover, the information presented in social technology is sometimes partial or false. This is also true for ourselves and how we present our lives in social media. I agree with Cristina and Katie in arguing that our online self is not completely our real, off-line self, as Pasquini states. Many aspects of our online self may not or cannot embody our real, off-line self. Moreover, the implications of this online self can have real consequences in our lives, these can mean losing a job or a friend.\nOn a related topic, Bonnie Stewart raises an interesting point, our digital identity is affected in large part by our audience. We often select what face or message we want to share in a given online space. I am thinking, for example, of how I present myself in different social technologies but also how those spaces inform or shape my performance through certain expectations.\nI often wonder, how much social technology doI want in my life? How much of a digital presence should I have in academia or my teaching?\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nV&R Map\nNext Post\nExperiences with Social Media and my Digital Idenity\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\nWrite a Comment...\nEmail (Required)\nName (Required)\nWebsite\nLoading Comments...\nComment\n×\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

I used Facebook particularly to connect with friends, family and\nacquaintances, but I was going to be on the job market and realized it could\naffect my professional career. As a result, I started deleting all my posts and\nthen decided I had to delete my accounts. A year later, I opened new social\nmedia accounts and was very strategic in the ways I used them. I found it was a\ndifferent experience, I had less friends and a lot more professional networks\nbut also more work. It became common for students to ask for letters of\nrecommendation via social platforms or for students to comment on my teaching.\nThese apps felt a lot like my Soots or my professional e-mails, so again I\ndecided to change how I was using these apps.\nI currently use Facebook, Messenger, Twitter, Slack, Skypeand Google specifically for academic purposes. In these social platforms, I mainly interact with academics, writers, professors, graduate students, researchers, and colleagues. I am happy with my current online interaction, although at times I feel I’ve had to sacrifice personal and social relationships with the people I know. For me, it was either a professional identity or a personal one, having multiple audiences was a challenge I was not ready to undertake. Perhaps, as I grow in my professional career I can change the ways I interact online. This goes back to a question Cristina made in her earlier blog, “how important will [my digital identity] be when I go up for tenure?” This is a tricky question, having a digital identity may affect our professional career but also not having one can have the same effect. It almost becomes suspicious for a person not to have a digital identity or be a critical online citizen. It is as if our online presence is a form of ID and not having one can implicate a lack of existence, credibility or citizenship.\nImage CCO Author Andres Chapparro from Pexels\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\n2\nbloggers\nlike this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nMy Current Networks and What I Want to Develop in a PLN.\nNext Post\nUncharted Territory\n(5) Comments\nCristina\nJanuary 16, 2019 at 5:11 pm\nReply\nI still think about this, Judy.

One has me not worried in the slightest; the other–well– it has me worried quite a bit about what it means not only for professional development and what it means for thinking about the relationship between privacy and the perspective that views education primarily as character formation.\nWhy I’m not worried at all: context collapse, as Bonnie Stewart judges, is inevitable, and I think there’s good reason to greet the inevitable with an embrace of welcome and an eye towards sifting out opportunities for transformative, sustainable change. Whether the line is invisible (as is the case for the person living with a pacemaker), or visible (consider, for example, the person who uses a prosthetic limb), or completely imaginary (as happens to many of us when we believe we are sensing our phones vibrating or or hearing them ring, when in fact they aren’t), the line between the technologies we use and the persons we are is dissolving before our eyes. (I’m also wearing contact lenses right now, which only to me reinforces the point.) Moreover, I also think that dissolving that line is exactly what all good technologies should do, or they wouldn’t be worth inventing. After all, when I write something (like this post, even), I am placing myself “in front of you” as a reader, providing a representation of myself that is inevitably stylized. This allows “me” to be multiple places at once, and–as long as servers survive–“I’ll” be alive forever. Digital presences–whether fostered by LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, or some other platform–seem by my assessment to do pretty much the same thing, at least in this respect.\nNow, from another angle, I think there might be some reasons to be concerned about context collapse. One is that there may be in some cases good reason for cultivating multiple, perhaps even contradictory, digital identities. One reason: the preservation of privacy. I think it’s simply the case that not everything about one’s life is relevant for people to know. In many cases, my employer should be be able to find out if I’m doing an exceptionally good job in rendering service to the profession; on the other hand, there’s no reason in hell why that same entity should be aware of whether or not I’m a nudist anarchist who makes posts to that effect on various platforms. Another reason: awareness of how social power in a racialized system punishes. It seems unfortunately true that many scholars-of-color render themselves complicit in the very academic structures that they identify as oppressive, though it might not be safe for their employers to know that they are working to dismantle those very structures.\nBut, the main reason why I think we should be concerned about context collapse is that I’m not sure that we can do the work of transformative learning–whether as those who undergo professional development or as those who educate others–without these sorts of private spaces.\nThe condition for the possibility of learning, it seems to me, is trust. Yet this is one of the crucial things that cannot be guaranteed with a credential or with a terminal degree. It can be validated only in the context of a relationship that grows over time. But if this is the case–if, indeed, education is a temporal process–then, choosing to document that process (whether we do that with discussion boards, journal entries, or some other artifact) will be a choice to document our own transformation.\nNow, there will certainly be cases where this poses no major concern. A documented history of wrong answers in say, math classes, can easily turn into a badge of honor when one begins to produce the right answers. But what about courses or professional development modules where we are learning about–or, perhaps more importantly, where we are\nunlearning\n–the sexisms, racisms, and homophobias that provided the backgrounds to our intuitions about fairness, honesty, and responsibility? In these situations, the dangers of context collapse–the danger of being unable to have a cordoned-off digital identity where one is a student learning to dismantle the effects of these systemic oppressions–are most palpable.\nIn other words, if we are going to learn in a world like our own, where context collapse is inevitable because the lines between our digital selves and the technologies we use to mediate ourselves is collapsing, we need nevertheless to create spaces to fail, spaces without collapse. Otherwise the fear of a public dragging will lead not only to a resistance to the learning process itself, but also to the arrival of the most demonic of rationalizations for that resistance: that because we teach our students (rightly) that some of the ways in which they have been educated in the past reflect the workings of ideology, they draw the conclusion that all forms of education–even transformative ones–are necessarily ideological. That is too high of a price to pay if we want to build a better world; if we want to build a world where #blacklivesmatter; if we want to build a world where all those, regardless of gender and sexual identity, are given the most basic and beautiful gifts of pride and self-respect.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nThe mute button\nNext Post\nWhere’s the Poetry?\n(1) Comment\nThomas Bolin\nJune 9, 2020 at 8:42 pm\nReply\nCraig, your point about reasons to have some sort of separation, to avoid context collapse, as essential in allowing people to work through and work out their moral growth is important and overlooked.

I started to care about social media and also my life online about my junior year of high school. Growing up, I lived in the country and had basically no internet, I didn’t have a phone until 13 and I didn’t have a smartphone until sophomore year. Sure, I grew up with technology more than my parents, but it didn’t really control my life like some children today.\nIn my life, I feel like each major social media I use has a different and distinct purpose. The main ones I use are Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, and Facebook. I scroll through Instagram the most because I enjoy pictures the most. However, sometimes it can be hard to realize that everyone only puts the best parts of their lives online, and it’s not an accurate representation of their life. My main use of Snapchat is to message people and groups. Facebook is mainly used if I want to connect to my family because they are the majority of my “friends” on Facebook.\nThe social media platform I use in what I would call the weirdest way is Twitter. I don’t think I have ever actually tweeted anything, I only like things and scroll through my feed. For me, Twitter tends to be the most real platform. I have found that the majority of people on Twitter actually share their life stories and the bad parts of their life alongside the good parts, instead of only the perfect aspects.\nThe easiest and hardest site for me to post on is my own blog. I have a decently normal and boring life compared to many others. I always feel like there has to be an exciting event or reason for me to post on my blog and that past few months my life has been very boring and bland. The other difference with my blog is I never know who will read the posts. I share the posts through my Facebook, so most of the people reading them are my family, but it is out on the internet for anyone to see. Writing for such a broad audience is definitely the hardest part about having a blog.\nOver the past couple of years, I have also realized how ridiculously careful I have to be online because of what I post, but especially because of the posts of others. I have heard many stories of those whose careers and lives have been basically ruined because of one picture or post online. Scrolling through social media on the weekends, I see so many posts of people at parties and drinking and I can’t imagine if something would happen if I was in that position. I have worked so hard for my education my entire life and I don’t know what I would ever do if that was all thrown away.\nOne of the activities this week for the Digital Identity week was to create a Visitor and Resident map of the different social media I use. Here is my Visitor and Resident Map\nMy Visitor and Resident Map\nHere is the explanation of each of the social media and technologies I have listed (from left to right):\nSearching- I almost always know what I am looking for when I google search something and rarely ever go to the second page of results\nEmail- I only send emails to individuals or very small groups of people. I mainly use email for school, some personal emails\nSnapchat- I mainly use Snapchat to message individuals or small groups of people. I very rarely post on my story for all of my friends to see\nGoogle drive- Mostly I use google drive for school, mainly writing papers. If anything is shared it is usually in a group of very few or for a class presentation\nFacebook- I am mainly Facebook friends with friends and family, however a lot of pictures you can see by just searching my profile and not even being my friend\nTwitter- Twitter was the hardest box to place. I really only go on twitter to look at what other people post and never really post anything of my own ideas\nInstagram- Instagram is one of the most social platforms that I use and up until college my entire profile was public for anyone to see and react to my posts\nTexting- Texting for me is very much targeted social activity and very personal activity.\nMy Domain- This platform is the most social of all of the others I use. When you google my name, it is one of the very first items that appear\nOverall, I have realized over the past year or so how addicting social media can be. About six months ago, I took a weekend break from (most) social media and I found it to be incredibly freeing. However, I have realized that I am so connected to my phone and social media and it is incredibly hard to give it up for even a few hours. I hope that I can give up social media for a bit because it has also taught me how toxic social media can be, especially Instagram due to the comparison of how one person’s life compared to mine.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nSocial Technologies\nNext Post\nDays Late, Dollars Short\n(2) Comments\nCristina\nJanuary 11, 2019 at 4:34 pm\nReply\nThanks for sharing this, Cassie.

I really hope that more people did think of the consequences but many people don’t think of the effects of one post on social media.\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\nWrite a Comment...\nEmail (Required)\nName (Required)\nWebsite\nLoading Comments...\nComment\n×\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

Like others, I sometimes hesitate to share things online. However, I think this reluctance is subconscious, at least in the case of personal postings. On personal platforms I should be comfortable with my audience since it is made up of mostly friends and family. I saw an Instagram post talking about how hesitating to share in personal spaces can be related to fear of “getting political” or being judged by peers. Both of these situations encourage a reevaluation of your personal online space and who that space is shared with. Since many people distinguish between personal and institutional platforms, I think it’s important to be comfortable online in our personal spaces, especially for those just establishing a digital presence.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nDigital Identity\nNext Post\nMultiple Identities Take Work!\n(1) Comment\nDebbie Kupinsky\nJune 7, 2020 at 6:05 pm\nReply\nI totally understand not wanting controversy, but the space can be anything you want it to be.

The professor and TA’s not only engaged in online discussions with\nstudents but went beyond by creating interactive assignments and activities. This\nwas a pioneering project at the time and it seemed to be a favorite among undergraduate\nstudents. It was a virtual interactive game where students would create their\nown avatar and immerse in a group of missions.

In answering questions, avatars would gain certain tools that advanced their\nmission.\nAt first, I was skeptical about this activity, I had seen my\nyounger siblings playing similar games and they just didn’t seem educational.\nHowever, I was completely wrong, many of these games are educational because\nthey require people to think critically and perform certain tasks. In this\ncourse, students not only did all the readings but went beyond by doing their\nown research outside of class. I just felt in love with digital learning, we were\nconnecting with our students and they were genuinely interested in the course. It\nwas a success!\nHowever, it was also very stressful for us. The many programs\nand platforms that we had to use and the endless technical errors we didn’t\nknow how fix were our major challenges. The professor and the TA’s were\nconstantly meeting with IT to resolve these issues and many times the solutions\nweren’t simple. Also, our challenges grew with the development of the program.\nIn the future, I would like to pursue creating a similar online\ninteractive experience in my Latin American Civilization and Culture course,\nhowever, this would be a long-term project that I would need to develop in\ncollaboration with colleagues and students. I am excited for the opportunity to\nexplore new horizons that will allow me to connect with my students outside of\na traditional classroom and in exciting new spaces.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nReflections on Digital Pedagogy and Digital Spaces\nNext Post\nBeing Gullible in a World Filled with Fake News\n(4) Comments\nKatie G\nJanuary 26, 2019 at 2:42 pm\nReply\nJudy,\nThis project sounds fantastic! Did the students interact with each other while online? It sounds like an amazing experience for everyone involved! I really like the way that it adds a game element to the class. A course that is fun and educational is sure to be a success. Do you know if this course is still offered? Have they made any substantial modifications to it?\nReid\nJanuary 26, 2019 at 3:15 pm\nReply\nThis is exciting Judy.  I have been interested in finding ways to use interactive games and simulations at the college.  I would like to hear more about how this simulation game was set up.  Was it designed by local folks, or did you work with a provider?\nJudy Cervantes\nJanuary 31, 2019 at 1:52 am\nReid, it was so much fun! The game was designed by the professor and 2 TA’s that were technology savvy. The team worked with Creative Commons for licensing.

Bonnie Stewart’s post really hit home when she talked about moribund blogs, because I have one! Regarding blogs and identity, Stewart notes, “You have to cobble that self together from the nearly infinite contexts and selves reflected back at you by the disco ball of the blank screen. It’s what makes the dead-letter pile of all the millions of blogs choking the internet.” I felt seen.\nI made list of all the places that I could think of where I’m digitally present:\nTwitter\n, Facebook, Instagram, my\nblog\n,\nHumanities Commons\n(a place for academics to share their research) Loom, some online publications,\nmy CV\n, Google Docs.\nDave White’s model of visitor-resident as a replacement to immigrant-native is\nreally important\n. I’ll be using these categories in my classroom, and especially when I talk with administrators about our students. The map I made brought something to light I hadn’t though about before.\nWhat struck me is that I’m rarely a visitor online. I put Instagram on the boundary because I don’t look at posts from people whom I don’t follow, and I only follow friends. Twitter and Facebook, however, are good examples of Bonnie Stewart’s collapsed contexts, especially Twitter. My account isn’t private and, while I do present an “academic” face I also tweet about lots of other things, serious and whimsical. Given that most of my interactions are with other academics, I know that I’m pretty typical. On Facebook, I have many academic friends whom I’ve never met “IRL” but with whom I have collaborated on writing projects, conferences, etc.\nIn my discipline, we have a whole section in our scholarship statement about the importance of public scholarship, and that’s something that I think informs part of my digital identity.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\n2\nbloggers\nlike this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nIs there anybody out there, just nod if you can hear me!\nNext Post\nDigital Identity\n(2) Comments\nTaylor\nJune 3, 2020 at 5:22 pm\nReply\nI’m glad to read that you resonated with the Visitor Resident model, in my experience the digital native way of thinking can sometimes lead to assuming  students just “know this stuff” when using different digital platforms, thinking about identity etc. In my opinion this is often not the case.\nI’ve helped a few faculty do V&R mapping in courses that had public writing components, and students seem to often find it useful!\nDiana VB\nJune 4, 2020 at 6:18 pm\nI found the readings insightful as well. In looking at your map on slack and before reading your post, the first thought that came to mind was of a robust resident – balanced between both professional and personal worlds. Your post seems to say as much. As I tend towards the visitor/reluctant resident end of the spectrum I appreciate your embrace of the resident space especially that it also suggests possibility.  Visual representations do carry their own power.\nLeave a Reply to\nTaylor\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\nWrite a Comment...\nEmail (Required)\nName (Required)\nWebsite\nLoading Comments...\nComment\n×\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

When you say “thank you” to the waiter who brings you those scallops (yum!) or ask the farmer at the CSA how many more weeks of asparagus are left, that’s a little, authentic, incomplete snapshot of you in that moment in your life. So you might think about how those little moments with new acquaintances relate to new digital-first acquaintances.\nSometimes those moments become part of something bigger… I’m currently making an effort to learn the staff’s names at my local coffee shop. (This is mostly because a new staff member introduced himself and I got embarrassed that I didn’t know the rest of the staff.) And sometimes a little moment is all there is… I recently moved offices and threw out a whole bunch of business cards for people who I’m sure were perfectly nice, and I hope I was fully present with them, but I really can’t remember them now.\nOf course the big difference is that our digital interactions do leave a reviewable footprint. There are certainly a few interactions I’ve left out there which I’m not proud of anymore. (I was probably authentically proud of them at the time, but time wounds all heels.) So it is a little different than managing ephemeral interactions where we’ve only got memories to go on instead of evidence.\nSarah\nJune 26, 2018 at 11:44 pm\nThanks for that Joe! Good point about the difference between ephemeral IRL interactions and the (minor) footprint left by digital interactions. Perhaps that’s part of my hang up as well as the lack of body language which says so much more than words.\nautumm\nJune 25, 2018 at 1:59 pm\nReply\nThanks for this post Sarah. Authenticity is always something that comes up when we start talking about identity. Here is the thing…. I don’t think that even in the flesh you can really portray your in-depth authentic self all of the time to everyone. Do you worry about being your authentic self with the person at the check-out counter? If you do worry about it do you feel that the encounter even gives you enough time and tools fo expression to really flesh it out? I’m thinking no. You do the best you can with what you have in that brief encounter to bring yourself to that person. Perhaps you smile and make small talk or perhaps you need to ask to talk to a manager because of problem. Either way you do the best with what you have and with the tools and customs of the environment to bring the elements of who you are to that space.\nI hope this helps. I also hope that through DigPINS that you can find some tools that allow you to express yourself.\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

This problem is exaggerated online and it can lead to many problems. I rarely share articles or information online, but, I will ask people and they will look at me a bit different. They have said, “Cassie, you know that’s not real, right?” I always like to see the good in people and trust them, but online that is a real problem.\nAmy Collier’s talk about trusting people online really has made me reevaluate how I am looking at news online. One of the many tips I will use in the future is seeing if more than one source is covering a story. I also want to get in the habit of checking what site the story is on and reading the comments to see what other people feel.\nRecently, there has been a post going around Facebook and Twitter about the freezing temperatures and the homeless in Chicago. The post claims that at least 15 people have died in the cold on Chicago streets, and features a picture of a person seeming to be freezing on the side of the street. I believed right away, as I usually do, but this time I thought about it for a minute. I had never seen this story anywhere else, and I felt like it would have been broadcasted more. I Googled the story and did not see any other results and was very skeptical and later found out it was fake.\nTaking a second to think about if an article could be fake and not always trusting everything is a something I am trying to learn. Going forward, I hope that I think before I become angry or before I share and make not trust everything I see online.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nDigital Pedagogy\nNext Post\nMy Journey with #digPINS\n(2) Comments\nCristina Ortiz\nFebruary 1, 2019 at 2:06 am\nReply\nFake news!!!!

As a facilitator of the community I can’t promise I’ll have the bandwidth to blog with everyone for every week but digital identity is something that I’m fascinated by and my thinking has been stimulated by all of our conversations and I was inspired to jump in.\nSelves and Spaces\nDigital identity is an interesting topic to me because it falls in this intersection of who a person is and what impact their environment has on the way they present themselves and how those two realms interact with one another. This is also why I appreciate how the identity week and the networks week in #DigPINS sort of feed into one another.\nWe like to think that we get to make the choice about who we are and while I think that we have a lot control over defining ourselves I can’t shake how much we are defined by our environments, the roles that we hold, and those that we are surrounded by.\nWe like to think that we have the luxury of precisely and specifically defining ourselves for the world but that is never the case. This becomes particularly problematic in thinking about digital identity because there is a plethora of rhetoric both condemning and advocating for presentation of self online that just muddies the waters.\nOne side of this paradigm promotes presentation of self, in excess, in as many platforms as possible, toward a complete representation of an authentic self, and holds up this idea as a way to become more in tune with who you are through the connecting with others. This is flawed of course but no better is the other side which sees digital connecting as narcissism and navel gazing at best and demonizes any kind of presentation of self online.\nActive listening\nIn 1956, Donald Horton and R. Richard Whol published “\nMass communication and para-social interaction: Observations on intimacy at a distance\n” in the journal Psychiatry. Here, they brought in a new concept and term – the parasocial interaction. They observed that there was a one-sided social interaction that spectators could experience with television characters that could begin to feel like a personal relationship to some. If you have ever had a crush on a celebrity or hoped that your favorite TV character might fall in love with another character, you have had a parasocial interaction.\nParasocial interactions most often are healthy and normal and can even aid in self-development.\nBut for me this begs to ask a question about digital identity. Horton and Whol were looking at connections that spectators were making with people on television but in our modern times so many have the opportunity to create environments where they can be watched and where they try to build an audience. So many who are not professional actors or journalists. I’m sure there is more literature about how spectators of online content creators have parasocial interactions. I need to look into this more but I’m curious how this bleeds together when the content creators are connecting with each other.\nOur identities are not just shaped by the digital creations we put out but by how they are received by those who read, view, and consume what we create. I’d like to suggest that as humans we are bigger than what we create. Be we celebrity or low-level education blogger we can’t control every aspect of how our creations will be received. They cannot represent the whole of who we are and yet it seems there persists an expectation that they should. Is this because we are used to parasocial connections that are made with those who are professionals in making content? Are we comparing our digital representations of self to those that have whole production teams behind them?\nReal and Authentic Selves\nI have a complicated relationship with the way we use the word “real” in online spaces. In terms of digital identity the word “authenticity” is another that gives me pause. It seems that those two narratives that I mentioned before – those two extremes: utopian presentation of self in excess and the other that shuns digital representation – both of these paradigms love to use these words. Both ascribe to the idea that “real” and “authentic” are things that could be simple. Simple as excess of content or lack of content in favor of physicality.\nIt rings more true for me that our “real” selves are much more complex than we want to admit and that our audiences, friends, and yes even families know us in contexts and environments that align to different presentations of self. That I don’t behave the same way with my family that I would in a job interview or in this blog post is normal and healthy. I think that expectations that we be all things in all contexts are misplaced.\nI recognize that this is dangerous territory,  and I should be clear that I’m not advocating for any of this at a lack of personal integrity. I am advocating for sincerity over authenticity and finding a way to celebrate digital contextualization that is not based in celebrity but in something closer to every-day experiences. It seems that if we can do that anywhere that it would be in learning spaces.\nI’m excited to start week 2 around networks and I’m really grateful that #DigPINS gives us all an opportunity to discuss these concepts.\nThis post is cross posted on my personal blog at\nhttp://autumm.edtech.fm/2019/01/14/digital-identities-and-real-selves/\nImage CC0 Author Foundry from Pixabay\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nDays Late, Dollars Short\nNext Post\nDigital Identity and Media Consumption\n(1) Comment\nDigital Identities and “Real” Selves – Is a Liminal Space\nJanuary 14, 2019 at 7:02 am\nReply\n[…] This post is cross listed as part of the January 2019 #DigPINS cohort that I helped to facilitate at https://snc.digpins.org/uncategorized/digital-identities-and-real-selves/ […]\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

HOW WOULD I LIKE TO CURATE MY DIGITAL IDENTITY?\nThis will sound ridiculous, given what I’ve just shared, but in part, because I have listed my social media accounts on my cv, I feel like I should be paying more attention, in the form of providing care and feeding for my accounts.  My hope is that this work will help me do that.\nAlso counterintuitively, I really do feel like I wish I could put some good into the digital world, “good” either because something I might share could provide a positive counterpoint to so much of the garbage that exists (primarily in comments sections, I suppose), or because sometime I think things just need to be said.  If no one else is saying them, then I’d like to be able to do so.\nAs with this post, at the end of our time together I may have proven once again beyond the shadow of a doubt that, no, I do NOT have anything the world needs, and even that would be helpful, I suppose.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nExperiences with Social Media and my Digital Idenity\nNext Post\nDigital Identities and “Real” Selves\n(2) Comments\nautumm\nJanuary 14, 2019 at 6:12 am\nReply\nI think you are too hard on yourself Corday.

It put me in my current mood (see otter for reference) which has lingered in decreasing intensity throughout the week. I’m glad writing it was therapeutic for you, Anne Helen Petersen, but I could’ve done without the reminder that despite how hard I work I will most likely never be as financially successful as many before me.\nThe article did spark thoughts on how our burnout, fueled by many things including financial instability, affects our work as professionals in higher education. Are we more empathetic to our students’ struggles? Or are we less tuned in? Are we more versatile, willing to experiment with new methods of teaching? Etc. Building off these questions, I spent some time contemplating how our perspectives/intersecting identities affect the way we approach teaching and learning digitally.\nDigital Teaching & Learning\nI currently only teach one course called Gateway, it is in the same spirit as a freshman seminar course. I primarily used Google classroom to communicate with my students outside of our meeting times. In hindsight, I wish I had done a brief survey on how helpful the students found Google classroom. I put up general reminders (add/drop dates, withdraw deadline, etc.) as well as information specific to our class (room change, remember tech, etc.). My student mentor also started a group chat using Whatsapp.\nThis was my first year really utilizing Google classroom and Whatsapp to interact and communicate with students. There seemed to be a lot less confusion and miscommunication than previous years when I relied on email alone.\nI am not sure if I will use any other tools or digital venues next year but this week has opened by eyes to the sheer plethora of options and capacity for creativity. Prior to my experiences in #DigPINS, I did perceived online learning to be rigid and dull. If anyone else shares the sentiment, I would encourage you to explore\nhttp://netnarr.arganee.world/\n.\nUntil next week, friends!\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nContagions in Twitter vs. Blogs vs. Podcasting\nNext Post\nMy Digital Project Disaster\n(2) Comments\nTaylor Jadin\nJanuary 25, 2019 at 9:52 pm\nReply\nAnne Helen Petersen’s article also put me in a bad mood after reading it again, too.\nThat aside, I’d be curious to know if next time you teach Gateway if you do get feedback from students on how you use Google Classroom what their thoughts are. In my experience it’s not so much WHICH tool you use, but HOW you use it. It sounds like you are posting in Classroom frequently and using it for other useful reminders, so that probably creates a positive experience, but not everyone uses the tool in that way.\nReid\nJanuary 26, 2019 at 4:41 pm\nReply\nOpportunity abounds in Gateway for using digital tools and strategies.

For our friends we are one person, another person with our parents, another person with our spouse, and so on. This week’s topic, Digital Identity, got my wheels spinning and got me thinking about who exactly we are online and how we present various selves depending on our audience. There was a rather interesting quote in the Pasquini reading that stated “as your online self is your real, off-line self”. I would argue much differently. If you look through the comments of any gossip website you’ll see various inappropriate comments from people who feel a sense of freedom and power and express themselves much differently than they would in real life. If you look on facebook or instagram you find people promoting a lifestyle, relationship, etc. that they want you to believe that they have. So it leads me to question how real are our digital identities, especially when it comes to professional digital identities. How much are we censoring, how much are we revising and editing before we hit submit on a post, how much are we being shaped by our audience and how we want them to perceive us??\nThe reading also talked about the stakes being high, addiction of social media, and how our online presence is evaluated online. I would argue that as professionals we are much more aware of how high the stakes are and how responsible we have to be with our digital identity than a teen or an individual in their early 20s. I am extremely grateful that social media didn’t really exist when I was in college — a time when students are supposed to have tons of fun and not worry about a picture being posted that can haunt you forever, especially professionally!!! I digress…\nAll this to say, I have thought a lot about my digital identity over the past five years or so. There was a time when I was very active on instagram and twitter. Then, as the article mentioned, I realized how addictive it was and how much time I was wasting and how meaningless feedback or reactions could dictate my emotions for the day. So, professionally, I struggle with having a digital identity and not falling back down the rabbit hole because it is extremely hard to separate the two….\nI also wonder, is having a digital identity really necessary? For whom? How important will it be when I go up for tenure and are those who are evaluating my tenure portfolio taking my digital identity seriously or are they scoffing at my online presence and thinking I could have spent my time doing something more productive???\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\n4\nbloggers\nlike this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\n#DigPINS January 2019\nNext Post\nVarious reflections on “going public” with your digital persona\n(4) Comments\nRuthie\nJanuary 9, 2019 at 12:44 am\nReply\nAs a current student and one who grew up with social media, I can say that I agree and disagree with your statements. First, I find that I obsess over what I post on Instagram, Facebook, or anything that I post. So I agree that we become addicted to social media, regardless of age. The only statement that I can say differently to is worrying about my digital identity. I have always been aware of what I post because I know that it’s public. I am always cautious about things that I share because I know that it’ll be out there forever. However, this is the way that it has always been for me, so I see no impact.\nI enjoyed your post!\nAutumm\nJanuary 9, 2019 at 3:10 am\nReply\nHi Cristina,\nThanks so much for this compelling post. It is really refreshing to hear you speak about some of the complexity around identity and environment. Often when talking about digital identity the word “authenticity” comes up. I find this term highly problematic for the reasons that you state. We are never presenting ourselves in a stable consistent way across all environments – that would not be human. We shift the way we present ourselves based on context – this is normal. If I were speaking with my mother I would speak differently than if I were speaking in a job interview. Yet everyone strives for the single shining authentic self that is flawless and pristine – especially online.\nBut it is here that I would say that Pasquini is making a point about a very specific context. She is not citing anonymous posts on gossip sites – she is specifically speaking about a scholarly/academic public persona (and I would argue that her points are easily transferred to other professional contexts). When working in that kind of environment, with a recognizable digital identity that is tied to scholarly outputs – well the stakes are just much higher or “real” as some like to say. I think that is her point anyway.\nYou also bring up a really important point about who has time and privilege to maintain a scholarly digital ID – it is highly problematic.\n@Clelis\nJanuary 9, 2019 at 8:54 pm\nReply\nCristina, you bring up some interesting points. The one that caught me was ‘are those who are evaluating my tenure portfolio taking my digital identity seriously.’  Whether they are or aren’t, just the fact that you have to guess who your audience is and what they want is stressful. In this time of rapidly changing norms, it’s hard to know where to direct our limited time and how to tailor our efforts. What is casual conversation and what is critical? Which comment will decide our professional identities? The stakes are high.\nThat has left me feeling overwhelmed and disengaged-no one can be all things to all people, but it feels like we’re being expected to navigate all expectations of all people at any time now or in the future.\nThe V&R mapping allowed me to visualize how I have reacted to this by trying to keep a hard line between my personal and institutional identities.\nThanks for the thought-provoking post.\nAvery\nJanuary 10, 2019 at 9:34 pm\nReply\nUgh, Cristina, you captured so much of what I’ve been feeling and thinking this week so eloquently! Thank you for this post. I do question how important having a digital identity is. I have a LinkedIn because I did think it was important to have SOMETHING but I vehemently dislike Facebook and feel mostly neutral or uninterested about most other social media platforms.\nYour first paragraph about perceptions of self and others brought back the concept of “context collapse” from our readings. I think context collapse is a large reason I feel such apprehension about posting but also this feeling of loss of control.\nThanks again!\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

I am in awe of those individuals who words seem to effortlessly flow out of into coherent, cohesive, and even captivating posts, articles, blogs, etc.\nWho am I online?\nI googled myself this Monday to see what I would find. The answer is, not much! I have never had a Twitter account and only briefly had Snap-chat, Instagram, and Facebook accounts. The only other “traces” I found was an old wedding registry (oops) and a professional contact page that UW-Green Bay has yet to remove. I currently to do not have much in the way of a “digital identity.”\nWho would do I want to be? How would I like to curate my digital identity?\nIn an alternate reality, I think I would be active online on a blog or through Instagram or some other digital venue. I would be unfiltered, punchy, and awesome! But like I said….in an ALTERNATE reality. In this reality, when one slight misstep can follow you forever I cannot imagine being so free.\nWhen I think about who I am – my irrational aversion to large swaths of technology and “the man” – I think that my digital identity is a very reserved and carefully curated one. It has taken me three days to write this much. Even now I am thinking, am I being to informal? What do I have to offer that is worth writing down? Will I be criticized by a colleague? Will everyone else be better than me?\nI am usually absurdly confident but the internet, social media, technology  bring out this unabated apprehension. I am hopeful that #DigPINS will allow me to dip my toes in the water of crafting a digital identity and that my fellow cohort members will challenge me in new ways!\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nVR Map\nNext Post\nUnhappy Digital Citizens\n(2) Comments\nKatie G\nJanuary 10, 2019 at 3:22 am\nReply\nHi, Avery!

I got all kinds of hits, but many of them were other people with the same name. This affords you with a certain amount of anonymity, but it would make me nervous because I would not want other people to confuse me with someone else with the same name!\nI´m glad that you are on this journey and it will be fun to see how this digital initiative will challenge us to reflect and grow in regards to our digital selves.\nC-C\nJanuary 16, 2019 at 1:41 am\nReply\nHi, Avery!

I was in graduate school and  enjoying the free time that I had. Since then, I’ve spent a lot of time cutting down on my online time and specifically who I interact with. I’ve done several Facebook purges where I literally went through my friend list and asked myself if I was comfortable sharing details of my private life with that person. Needless to say, a lot of people were deleted. I’m still on Facebook, but very strategic about my presence, or lack thereof. All this to say I don’t really interact with many people, but I do a lot of perusing and learning from others. So instead of a two-way network, I’ve chosen to have one-way interactions with my network. I guess similar to Corday, I’ve thought a lot about what I can possibly contribute and questioned it. In the past week alone after being part of DigPins I’m learning more about what I can contribute, but not sure I’m entirely comfortable doing so!!\nHow do you find and join networks?\nThe networks I’m part of change with the season. I think about what I need At that point in my life and seek out networks. Right now a lot of my networks revolve around the parenting style I’ve adopted.  Next week I’ll be joining a network that focuses on scholarly productivity and accountability. For me, it’s always need-based and I seek out what will help me grow.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nDigital Identity and Media Consumption\nNext Post\nMy Current Networks and What I Want to Develop in a PLN.\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

The only “teaching” I do consists of me trying to reexplain items that friends and classmates don’t understand from their classes.\nThe core subject I consider myself the best at is math, but ask anyone close to me and they will tell you I am a horrible math tutor or teacher. This is because my brain works and understands a little bit differently than most other people. I understand math easily, meaning I am one of the worst people to try to teach math because I can’t explain how I understand it, I just do.\nThe other area I “teach” the most would be website design. One of the main reasons I am horrible at teaching is I am horrible at explaining why I just understand how. I also tend to take over and try to do everything myself. I very much like having control, and instead of explaining the problem, I just take over and fix it myself.\nI always claim I never want to be a teacher, but learning different ways to teach technology to others was definitely beneficial for me.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nMy Digital Project Disaster\nNext Post\nReflections on Digital Pedagogy and Digital Spaces\n(2) Comments\nReid\nJanuary 26, 2019 at 3:43 pm\nReply\nBy creating websites you are building learning environments.   Think about it as creating spaces for others to learn.   This is why instructional designers need to know a lot about learning and motivation.   If you design an engaging site that “pulls in” users, then you are doing the same thing a teacher does, facilitating learning.\nautumm\nJanuary 26, 2019 at 9:29 pm\nThis is an interesting juxtaposition that Reid brings up here. Inside of an educational institution we often call what he is describing “Instructional Design”. But work that is very similar happens outside of educational institutions and goes by the name “UX designer” or the like.\nLeave a Reply to\nReid\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

A few years ago, one of my colleagues presented an amazing assignment she created on Google+ and how she had her students create posts instead of traditional papers. Sounds easy enough, right???\nI attempted to recreate this assignment and failed, miserably. For my privilege class, I has students post for different topics over the course of the semester, all 15 weeks. I gave them about 12 topics, let them choose 8 topics to post about, and let them run free. What this turned into was a grading nightmare, tons and tons of email notifications, and me still receiving emails from these students about posts that have nothing to do with this class.\nI guess I can say I leaped before testing the waters. I’m in a weird generation (read, anti-millennial!!!) where I grew up without technology but began relying on it heavily in college. BUT, I am not up to speed. While Google+ seemed easy enough to tackle, I didn’t seek out help. I should have met with IT and really thought this process through.\nMoving forward, I have taken what I have learned so far from the DIGPINS experience and am once again making an attempt to incorporate digital projects into my classes. Thanks to Autumn, I am connected to IT and will be getting their help with this process and not doing this solo. While I am still traumatized by my first experience, I’m confident that Taylor will teach me what I need to know and this second go-round will be a success!!\nHere’s hoping!!!\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nSalty with a Side of Contemplation\nNext Post\nA Different Mindset\n(3) Comments\nTaylor Jadin\nJanuary 25, 2019 at 9:58 pm\nReply\nExcited to see what you can come up with for your next project and I’ll be excited to help out.

It put me in my current mood (see otter for reference) which has lingered in decreasing intensity throughout the week. I’m glad writing it was therapeutic for you, Anne Helen Petersen, but I could’ve done without the reminder that despite how hard I work I will most likely never be as financially successful as many before me.\nThe article did spark thoughts on how our burnout, fueled by many things including financial instability, affects our work as professionals in higher education. Are we more empathetic to our students’ struggles? Or are we less tuned in? Are we more versatile, willing to experiment with new methods of teaching? Etc. Building off these questions, I spent some time contemplating how our perspectives/intersecting identities affect the way we approach teaching and learning digitally.\nDigital Teaching & Learning\nI currently only teach one course called Gateway, it is in the same spirit as a freshman seminar course. I primarily used Google classroom to communicate with my students outside of our meeting times. In hindsight, I wish I had done a brief survey on how helpful the students found Google classroom. I put up general reminders (add/drop dates, withdraw deadline, etc.) as well as information specific to our class (room change, remember tech, etc.). My student mentor also started a group chat using Whatsapp.\nThis was my first year really utilizing Google classroom and Whatsapp to interact and communicate with students. There seemed to be a lot less confusion and miscommunication than previous years when I relied on email alone.\nI am not sure if I will use any other tools or digital venues next year but this week has opened by eyes to the sheer plethora of options and capacity for creativity. Prior to my experiences in #DigPINS, I did perceived online learning to be rigid and dull. If anyone else shares the sentiment, I would encourage you to explore\nhttp://netnarr.arganee.world/\n.\nUntil next week, friends!\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nContagions in Twitter vs. Blogs vs. Podcasting\nNext Post\nMy Digital Project Disaster\n(2) Comments\nTaylor Jadin\nJanuary 25, 2019 at 9:52 pm\nReply\nAnne Helen Petersen’s article also put me in a bad mood after reading it again, too.\nThat aside, I’d be curious to know if next time you teach Gateway if you do get feedback from students on how you use Google Classroom what their thoughts are. In my experience it’s not so much WHICH tool you use, but HOW you use it. It sounds like you are posting in Classroom frequently and using it for other useful reminders, so that probably creates a positive experience, but not everyone uses the tool in that way.\nReid\nJanuary 26, 2019 at 4:41 pm\nReply\nOpportunity abounds in Gateway for using digital tools and strategies.

At this conference, I attended Katina Rogers’ panel “Going Public: How and Why to Develop a Digital Scholarly Identity,” during which she stated that regardless of whether you want to be found online or not, these days it is incredibly difficult to hide from the Internet and the powers of Google. She continued by emphasizing that the traces of you that show up online are inevitably what others will use to form a first impression of you. Thus, she advocates for taking control of your image (instead of letting Google do it for you) and managing your own digital identity by (1) cultivating the content that you want associated with your name and (2) by “going public” with it.\nKatina Rogers’ talk at the MLA also echoed many of the same points made by Laura Pasquini in her piece “Why Academics need a Digital Persona,” particularly her observations regarding the use of digital technology to participate in conversations with colleagues in your field, or as Pasquini states, in order to “connect, learn and engage in the profession.” In fact, I have a Twitter account for this very reason, and I have found it incredibly helpful for not only discovering information and resources pertinent to my field, but also for staying abreast of what the most prominent voices are saying about academic topics that interest me.\nWhile I enjoyed reading Pasquini’s article, I agree with what Cristina wrote in her blog post, since I also do not view our online self as corresponding completely to our real, off-line self. Indeed, I believe that it is much more complicated than that. As Cristina pointed out, online identities can not only be censured and constructed to portray a certain image, but also, when we are speaking about one’s identity, there are inevitably many, many layers to who we are. My Twitter account, for instance, only provides one small window into who I am, or at least into how I present myself on that platform. And in regards to online platforms, my Twitter account and my Facebook account are not linked. I use them for completely different purposes that sometimes overlap, but for the most part are different windows into my life, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that they represent different\nfragments of my digital self\n. To add to this, there are elements of my off-line self that I share only with those that are dearest to me–those that have been with me for the long haul and are my most trusted confidants. But I’m going off on a tangent here… let me get back to the articles and the matter at hand…\nI found Bonnie Stewart’s piece to be thought provoking as well, and her reflection on one’s audience and who you are writing for is particularly useful when thinking about “going public” with your digital persona. I would, however, like to add to her comments concerning academics that are cautious regarding what is posted from their research, specifically during conference presentations. I believe that such hesitations are generally linked to questions involving ethics, power structures, and vulnerability, especially with those who are newer to the profession. At the MLA, in fact, some scholars stressed discretion in tweeting about unpublished research presented by junior faculty members, contingent faculty/staff, and students. It wasn’t that those at the conference were resisting this digital platform, it was that they were conscious of the vulnerability of those with less power and/or experience, and who are at more risk of getting their ideas scooped. While at the conference, I attended a fascinating presentation on a digital humanities project during which the junior scholar that was presenting asked the audience to refrain from posting photos of her project online since it is not yet finished. I find this to be completely understandable and believe that we must use technology in an ethical way that is not only respectful of others and of their work, but that in addition, does not take advantage of the most vulnerable among us.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nOur various selves\nNext Post\nVR Map\n(2) Comments\nAvery\nJanuary 9, 2019 at 10:15 pm\nReply\nHello Katie, I would have loved to attend the session you describe ““Going Public: How and Why to Develop a Digital Scholarly Identity.” It is true that whether or not we like it there are traces of all of us on the internet. Has anyone you’ve met professionally ever based their first impressions of you off of your digital identity? That is something I have thought about, has anyone ever googled me and used that information.\nKatie G\nJanuary 10, 2019 at 3:34 am\nHi, Avery! I don´t know if anyone has actually admitted that to me, but I confess that before I go to a conference, I tend to look up the speakers that interest me to see what topics they typically research and if we have any points in common. Without fail, certain websites related to teaching (and which shall not be named here!) show up with ratings of the individual´s courses. This is just one example how information online could contribute to the opinions that we form about others before we get to know them.\nAs a side note, at another panel related to technology at the MLA, they had audience members pair up and google each other to see how their searches were different. That would be a fascinating activity to do together in person!\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

Here is the link if you want to play:\nhttps://ncase.me/crowds/\nSlack, Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp: My main online networks\nIn looking at who I interact with online and how I interact with them, I see that much depends on the platform that I am using. As I mentioned last week, I use Twitter mainly for staying abreast of information in my field and connecting with other scholars, while Facebook has become a sort of catch-all for the many people that I’ve come into contact with over the years; it is mostly friends, family, and former students, although there are a few academic acquaintances that have been in my network for awhile now.\nI don’t post often in Facebook, and in fact, I rarely use Facebook to interact “publicly” with those closest to me. For these individuals, I tend to use iMessage and WhatsApp, with the latter being the platform that I use to communicate with my closest friends. When I think about it, WhatsApp is what has helped my group of friends to remain close now that we all live in different cities. In fact, our daily group chats make it so that we can pick up wherever we last left off when we talk on the phone or see each other in person.\nUnlike Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp, in Slack I interact with a community of writers and researchers, whose real names and faces I will never know. Taking part in a group like this would have sounded odd to me a few years ago, but their company, solidarity and words of encouragement helped me through the lonely task of writing a dissertation.\nNew directions and reflections on developing my personal learning network.\nWithin the last year or so, I have started using Facebook for more professional purposes. I now follow quite a few academic groups and departments to find out what the conversations in my field are and what other departments of languages, literatures, and culture are talking about. Nevertheless, I don’t post on their wall or share their posts on mine. This is mostly because I am aware of my audience on Facebook, and no one in my family is going to want to know more about the Spanish Film Series going on at the University of Kansas, for example. I know that I want to develop my personal learning network (PLN) more, and that is one of the reasons that I joined DigPINS, but I also know that I probably won’t be doing so through Facebook, as Twitter seems to be the better venue for this.\nThe readings this week have definitely made me think more about how I want to continue to curate my Twitter network, and I found the Nicky Case narrative game to be an informative (and fun!) way of helping me to visualize the way that networks work. I already follow a diverse group of academics on Twitter that specialize in a variety of fields that interest me, and I have found that doing so is helpful for learning about conferences, articles, and new books that have just come out. In addition, many also post teaching and writing resources that are useful for what I do. In the future, I would like to share more professional resources on Twitter and engage in conversations with other academics.\nAs I wrap up my reflections for this week, something that I’ve been wondering is how others deal with information overload. (Again, I’m thinking about the social media detox!) Does anyone have any strategies on managing this? Sometimes when I go on Twitter, I see so many interesting posts, articles, books, and comments, that in the end it just feels overwhelming. I want to cast a wide enough net where I see a variety of posts and conversations, but at times it just feels like I am being pulled in too many directions at once. Also, piggybacking on some of the sentiments in the article “How Millennials Became the Burnout Generation,” as my social media networks have begun to gravitate towards topics related to my field, I wonder if I have internalized the idea that I should be working all the time–including on social media.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nTo interact, or not to interact…. that is the question!\nNext Post\nCritical Citizen\n(4) Comments\nParisa\nJanuary 16, 2019 at 6:59 pm\nReply\nHi Katie!

Nice to see you here as well!\nGood to know that I am not the only one that feels overwhelmed with Twitter! Today in our digPINS video chat, we talked about Tweetdeck  and using lists to alleviate some of that. I want to be able to use Twitter in a scholarly way that is not overwhelming, so I will definitely heed their advice!\nCassie\nJanuary 16, 2019 at 10:17 pm\nReply\nOver the past few weeks while on break, I have had a similar problem of spending too much time on social media. Twitter can be overwhelming and I can seem to scroll through my feed sometimes for hours and it can be an unproductive use of my time. Last night for the first time I used the downtime feature on my iPhone to essentially lock my phone after midnight and force me to go to bed. They also have app limits on how much time a day you can spend on an app. I know these features are meant for kids, but it is helping me to see how much time a day I am spending on social media and each specific app.\nKatie G\nJanuary 17, 2019 at 12:42 am\nThanks for the comment, Cassie!\nI am always overjoyed when my phone tells me that my screen time was less than last week.\nAs for the apps that you mentioned, I applaud you for using them!

I created an avatar and entered a sandbox/tutorial just to mess around. Half way through choosing my clothes, I got bored, figured I had the general idea and jumped worlds. All of a sudden, I could hear real people talking about me. “What is she doing? What happened to her clothes?” I realized that I was expected to follow the IRL social norms. When I tried to talk to people and ask questions about where I was and what I should do, the avatars around me slunk away. One girl offered to help, but when she got bored after a few minutes, she hopped worlds and I was left on my own. Pretty sad state of affairs when you get dissed by cartoon characters. Also, startling to realize that there were people so vested in their online identity that they couldn’t be seen virtually hanging out with an ignorant, half-dressed, androgynous computer generated pixel-creature. I have learned to be more mindful of the sensibilities of the real people behind the online personas.\nProfessionally, I have been obligated a few times to create an online identity. I keep it as objective and minimal as possible for a variety of security and privacy reasons.\nKatie G\naddressed one of my major concerns in her Jan 9 2019 9:09 pm blog post:\nAt the MLA, in fact, some scholars stressed discretion in tweeting about unpublished research presented by junior faculty members, contingent faculty/staff, and students. It wasn’t that those at the conference were resisting this digital platform, it was that they were conscious of the vulnerability of those with less power and/or experience, and who are at more risk of getting their ideas scooped.\nThere are institutions and individuals who have a finders-keepers mentality online with little respect for copyright or attribution. Content creators who share freely find their work being monetized by mills, or see their work misrepresented, taken out of context, and their professional reputations compromised.\nMore than anything else, I perceive my online identity as a consumer and observer, not a creator of content. I would like to feel comfortable having a public identity. Who am I online? A lurker.\nWhat social traces do you leave?\nVery little:) When you search for me, you will find a list of places where I have lived and one where my identity was stolen. There is also a random set of relatives, my age, and my current address.  Many marketers seem to know some very intimate details of my financial status-not sure who’s selling it to them, but it’s pretty accurate. I have dabbled with a lot of sites (created a Moodle, student taught online for UW-Stevens Point, a deleted Facebook and Google Plus account, etc.) There are a couple of news articles I appear in. And, of course, this blog post.\nHow would you like to start / continue curating or shaping your digital presence and identity?\nI would like to blog about the things I know well, while maintaining control of my identity. Sounds like I have to let go of that second piece.

I feel like an intrepid explorer with my mouse and my keypad browsing through the good, the bad, the interesting, and the unabashedly ugly.\nConnecting\nThis exploration into uncharted territories has sparked many conversations with friends, coworkers, and my supervisor about social media, networking, digital identity, etc. One conversation in particular, served as a great precursor to Katia Hildebrandt’s writing, “(Digital) Identity in a World that No Longer Forgets.” We were talking about mistakes, forgiveness, the ability to grow as an individual, and how the internet/its audience seems to only focus on one of these: mistakes. When we look at this week’s theme, networks, along with the idea of making mistakes online – how might that impact resonate on and off-line? Will our networks, our audience grant forgiveness and give room for us to grow as individuals or will they partake in “cybervigilantism?”\nHildebrandt perfectly described my own worry that, “our every digital act might someday be scrutinized by someone, somewhere, the scope of what we can ‘safely’ discuss online is incredibly narrow and limited to the mainstream and inoffensive.” I do not believe that most companies, especially social media platforms, are naturally ethically or morally responsible. They will not, without pressure or demand, construct or facilitate environments that foster compassion and grace.\nAside from my newly formed Twitter account and an old LindedIn profile, I do not formally interact in many online networks. #DigPINS has thrown me into more forums at once than I think I have ever had. It has been interesting.\nQuestioning\nEntering this learning community, I expected that I would learn more about the value of having an online presence and curating a digital identity (which I believe I have) but I also expected that participating would kick off my desire to be more connected/digitally “present.” I cannot say it has done the latter. If anything, I am questioning the value in working to curate a digital identity beyond this project. I think it can be immensely valuable for many professionals. However, I do not know what I as an individual need a large online presence. On the other hand, the opportunity for an office or department presence is still worth considering.\nDespite my questioning, I am savoring the conversations sparked in and out of #DigPINS, and deeply appreciate the work everyone in this learning community has put into creating this experience.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nCritical Citizen\nNext Post\nUni Dilly Dilly\n(2) Comments\nKatie G\nJanuary 17, 2019 at 1:00 am\nReply\nThank you for your post, Avery!\nI have had a similar reaction in our first two weeks of DigPINS. Contrary to what I thought would happen, I am now developing more of an aversion to social media!\nThank you again for sharing, Avery. I’ll see you on Twitter!\nautumm\nJanuary 17, 2019 at 7:31 am\nReply\nGrrr – There was a blip with my connection and my first comment got lost so this is a second go – I wanted to preface this in case that comment does show up somehow…\nI just wanted to thank you for this thoughtful response Avery. DigPINS is not about advocating for social media or technology or digital identities for individuals. As a learning community we are not trying to hit outcomes so much as critically discuss topics and let folks draw the personal conclusions that work for them. Though you are not getting the experience that you’d expected it does sound like your thoughts on these matters are growing so I do hope that is valuable for you.\nI hope that you take some time to look at the suggested folks to network with for this week. Many of them take a very critical look at digital technology and social media on their blogs and on twitter. The paradox is of course that they do this through digital identity and networks. They contribute to a larger conversation that is pushing back against those techno-utopian narratives that I think also bother you. These voices are so important when that silicon valley rhetoric (tech is wonderful, you need your personal brand, connect as much as possible, share as much as possible, etc.) is pervasive and backed by lots of money. We need more voices like yours.\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\nWrite a Comment...\nEmail (Required)\nName (Required)\nWebsite\nLoading Comments...\nComment\n×\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

The stuff Case talks about in\nThe Wisdom and Madness of Crowds\nis not specific to any particular online or offline or type of media, so I’m going to apply this type of thinking to Twitter, blogging, and podcasting and see if I can come up with any interest comparisons or contrasts.\nTwitter\nAs Case points out, a large network with tons of connections between all of its members can lead to group think, which can make it difficult for complex, new, or challening ideas to gain traction. Platforms like Twitter can exacerbate this problem, with its 280 character limit. In addition to this retweeting makes it easy to copy and paste an idea on a large scale. This means that some things can get taken out of context and short and simple ideas can go viral easily.\nBlogging\nMost blogs sites would look very different as a network than a network on Twitter. Blog sites typically have less authors than readers\n[1]\nso these networks so I’ll call these one-to-many networks:\nExcuse my scribbles.\nThis is very different from the the networks we usually see in Case’s examples:\nAgain, excuse my scribbes. The drawings in The Wisdom and Madness of Crowds are way better.\nYou might say that one-to-many networks aren’t really networks at all, and are closer to a form of broadcast communication. That aside, it’s at least still useful for me to compare the two using Case’s language around networks and crowds, so I’m going to keep rolling with this one-to-many networks thing.\n[2]\nBlog sites do often have a comment section, where many people can participate, but these sections usually aren’t featured as prominently on the page, so they really feel more like a sub-network than a network to me.\nIn contrast to Twitter, blogs also have all the space the author needs to get a complicated idea across. The only real limitation here is how long you can hold an audiences attention.\nPodcasts\nPodcasts as a network have very similar one-to-many structure to blogs. Typically a successful podcast has a few hosts a large amount of listeners. Podcasts cannot offer comments sections like blogs do, although many podcast hosts welcome audience feedback and follow-up and will incorporate that into the show. What makes that different from blogs though is that that audience feedback is usually behind by one episode\n[3]\n, as the audience won’t have anything to react to until after the podcast episode has been published. Therefore feedback usually for a given episode of a podcast will, at the earliest, show up in time to record the next episode.\nPodcasts offer plenty of time for the creator to communicate a complex idea, as its not uncommon to see a runtime of 1 – 2 hours. On top of this, because podcasts usually have more than one host, the audience gets to here two or more people have a discussion about an idea, which can make it easier for the listener to relate to the discussion and feel like they’re a part of the conversation (even though they aren’t). Most of my favorite podcasts have a format that can essentially be summed up as “Three friends talk about a topic they all have in common.” For me this means that when I hear one of my favorite podcast hosts recommend something, it feels more like I’m a part of their network, and so that recommendation is more valuable to me.\nSuccessful ones do anyway. For my purposes I am going to say that in order for a blog to be a network, it neads to have some kind of audience.\n↩︎\nDon’t stop me now.\n↩︎\nUnless the podcast is broadcasted live while they record. Some hosts will choose to do this and offer a\nlive chat room.\n↩︎\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nRelating to the millennial Generation\nNext Post\nSalty with a Side of Contemplation\n(1) Comment\nReid\nJanuary 20, 2019 at 2:58 pm\nReply\nInteresting.\nAs humans, we are social beings, we naturally create networks.  Networks provide a support system that helps us flourish.\nHistorically our networks were contracted around the immediate physical environment.  Digital tools can allow us to expand our networks beyond the geographic location.   What we seem to be discussing is the fact that these networks do not have the same characteristics as our immediate social network structures.  Taylor is highlighting how the medium impacts the nature of the network.  If we consider our visitor/resident maps, we begin to see that we likely have sets of interconnected and overlapping networks.   Thus, there is a complexity in our lives that pevious generations have not experienced.  We are grappling with what that means for our personal and professional lives as the technology continues to evolve and expand.\nLeave a Reply to\nReid\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

Although there are clearly through lines through identities, to a certain extent these identities differ in terms of affect, behaviors, and cognitions. That is, I may think and act very differently in the same situation, depending on what identity is active at the time. The common example I like to give in class is that you probably act differently in front of your grandma than you would at a party with friends. I know I would!\nWhat this week really showed me was that this extends quite well into the digital world. Not necessarily that we have a digital identity (i.e., a set of feelings, thoughts, and behaviors that only relate to our online selves), but that our digital behaviors are reflective of the identity that’s active at a certain time. After starting my digital identity analysis, I quickly realized that my I behave very differently online depending on whether my professional self or my personal self is active at the time. I tend to behave a lot more like a resident when my professional identity is active and a lot more of a visitor when my personal identity is active.\nI’ll be curious to see how my professional and personal social identities change over the course of this program (and my career). I would like to be more residential in my use of technology in the classroom (or more creation and conversation in the triangle model), and I hope this class will help me accomplish that. I also hope that I can facilitate students being more residential in their use of technology in their professional identities. Being a marketer in this age means that they are going to have to learn to create engaging content and have real conversations in the digital world.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nMe, Myself, and My Digital Identity\nNext Post\nForming Connections Digitally\n(1) Comment\nSusan\nJuly 2, 2019 at 2:46 pm\nReply\nMiles, I am curious what your reflections will be on your digital identities as you participate in this DigPINS learning community.

And, we might well ask, where else are our names written in this digital age?\nFacebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn? Oh, you don’t do social media! Do you search on google, do you use email, you have and/or read blogs, have you bought anything on line with Amazon prime, Amazon Smile, do you keep abreast of the Daylesford Abbey website, the NYTimes Cooking blog ? If so, your name is written everywhere forever.\nWe all have digital identities. Indeed, we have many. One person’s Buttigieg tweets might well give others a different idea of her than her Richard Rohr daily meditation site or her google searches.\nAnd it’s true for God too. Unfortunately for God, the Creator, Rescuer and Covenant identities got lost in the Satan-inspired and fake judge – blame – condemn website that took over the religious culture of Jesus’ time and is still, sadly, operative among Christians of all varieties.\nIf you get the picture I’m trying to paint then you can understand better why in today’s gospel Jesus has a vision of Satan falling like lightning from the sky. In terms of this homily, Jesus has hacked the hacker and disconnected his Wi-Fi. The seventy disciples sent by Jesus went to heal and bring the peace of God in the face of the sick, diseased and deeply anxious women and men beset with the Satan-the-hacker’s idea that their suffering was a sign of their disconnect from God, that God was punishing them for some wrong doing conscious or unconscious.\nThe disciples’ message of peace and healing without cost released people – and us – from ever thinking that earthquakes, the death of children, the onset of cancer or any other affliction is caused by God, much less be a punishment for sin. That’s the Hacker’s judge / blame / condemn fake news image of God.\nBut, from the beginning and for centuries, God was self-identifying as loving Creator and Rescuer, Protector and, in today’s reading from Isaiah, nurturing Mother. This prophetic image came in a time when God’s People were becoming discouraged and giving up on the rebuilding of Jerusalem after seventy years of exile. But we’re all rebuilding: the world, the nation, our university/college, our family, ourselves.\nThe prophet was calling them and now us to get to know and believe and act out of God’s authentic identity. The paradox is that God can’t be known and authentically identified except through God’s creatures — how we act from what we say we believe. This is why God’s clearest identity is seen in Jesus Christ who sends us to be disciples of peace and healing.\nSo, to return to the beginning and to stretch a point, just as our budgets reveal our values, so our daily words and deeds and even our digital identities (if fully known, God forbid!) speak to us and to others about the identity of God.\nBeware of hackers, beware of the big hacker falling like lightning from the sky!\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nPersonal Librarian Network\nNext Post\nConfronting the Dragon\n(2) Comments\nReid Riggle\nJuly 7, 2019 at 5:34 pm\nReply\nFantastic!

I joined Facebook in 2007 and started a Twitter account in 2010, in the middle of my graduate program in library and information science. I joined Facebook to creep on people I met in college. I joined Twitter to connect with other librarians and info science people as I prepared to enter the job market. My professors, my mentors, and my classmates spent a lot of time way back then debating what our online presence should be and what our role was as librarians both to contribute to a learning network as well as what it took to be curators of online networks. It’s interesting reflecting on these early days of the social Internet in today’s current times and seeing how the tension has evolved.\nI created a separate Twitter account to participate in #DigPINS, and so have been replicating my PLN to some extent, with a bit more attention to building a more professional network. My process is the same as when I built my first Twitter PLN though: to search #hashtags that will lead me to conversations I want to potentially be a part of, like #critlib (critical librarianship). I got into the habit in graduate school of looking up authors of articles I liked on the Twitters, and then following them to connect to their networks. I also look to see if they have blogs I can bookmark and will occasionally give them shout-outs on Twitter to let them know I admire their work and/or at least am reading their blog. At conferences, I will often look folks up on Twitter using conference hashtags and start following them to stay connected or to start a connection after the conference. I’m spending a lot of time scrolling through Twitter accounts of professionals I admire to see who they retweet and mention to find additional folks. I feel lucky that librarians and information science professionals normalized networking via social media way back when.\nI was waiting to see if Seaman would mention echo chambers in\nPersonal Learning Networks: Knowledge Sharing as Democracy\n, which she finally did, “It’s also important to include a range of voices in a PLN. Incorporating individuals with\ndiverse opinions\navoids the risk of the network becoming an ‘\necho chamber\n’, where dominant opinions are ‘echoed’ back to network members. This can obscure alternate viewpoints and\nprevent learning\nfrom taking place.”\nI was a bit put off by this article because I feel it simplifies 1) the work of Sherry Turkle and 2) echo chambers.\nAs we know, it’s much easier said than done to avoid an echo chamber in developing our PLNs, especially given the algorithms of today’s social media platforms. I’m going to keep thinking about this because I have a lot of thoughts still forming.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\n2\nbloggers\nlike this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\ngetting some ideas\nNext Post\nApplying Week Two\n(3) Comments\nAutumm Caines\nJuly 3, 2019 at 4:26 pm\nReply\nAlaina – I’m curious if you have ever used Tweetdeck and “Twitter lists” to help combat the echo chamber? I like them because I can “list” someone without having to “follow” them. I think part of the problem is that a follow feels so personal and other people can see who I follow. If I want to add people who I strongly disagree with to my timeline and I follow them that says something to that person and something to others who look at my followers page – and that is often not a signal I want to send. With a list I can still create a timeline of people (accounts) but I don’t have to follow them and with Tweetdeck I can put those lists right next to each other to juxtapose differing views without the signal that I agree with, accept, or want to promote those views.\nReid\nJuly 3, 2019 at 8:49 pm\nReply\nI appreciate the conversation about the risks of the echo chamber and look forward to hearing more about how we minimize this challenge.\nShan\nJuly 10, 2019 at 2:18 pm\nReply\n“As we know, it’s much easier said than done to avoid an echo chamber in developing our PLNs, especially given the algorithms of today’s social media platforms.” This is such an important thing you bring up–thanks for drawing attention to it.\nLeave a Reply to\nShan\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

I had what all the typical teens had: Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook. I used these platforms quite often, and tried to represent myself in the best light possible. I think that is something that plagues my generation and many others. We only share the best parts of our lives and hide away our real life.\nFor me, this was the biggest struggle. I am growing up with people always around me who are on their phones or at least always have their phones on them. In some sense, I was forced to have a digital identity otherwise I wouldn’t fit in. So I established myself, and rather unsuccessfully. I say this because another problem that my generation faces is the value of “likes.” We are beginning to value our self-worth through the number of likes that one gets. I would scroll through Instagram and see one of my peers get over one hundred likes on their picture. I remember struggling with the question of why I never got over a hundred likes. Was there something wrong with me? Did nobody like me? These sort of question plagued me whenever I would post anywhere online.\nHowever, as I got older, I realized that the number of likes I get doesn’t really matter. The amount of hearts or thumbs-up I receive do not change who I am. I had to remove myself from this digital identity that I created for myself. And while the number of likes doesn’t bother as much, if I’m being honest, it still affects me.\nMost people my age would say that they love social media and how easily to connects us with friends. While this is true, I think that we are all hiding from the fact of how negatively social media has affected us. It’s too often that my friends ask if their picture is “instagramable” (which means if it is good enough to post) or fret over the number of likes they got on their most recent post.\nI am grateful for my participation in DigPins to show me that social media doesn’t have to be scary! It doesn’t have to be this platform in which I hesitate about every post or comment I make. The internet doesn’t have to be a scary place, and that is what I’ve learned so far this week.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nHello Friends\nNext Post\nV&R Map\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\nWrite a Comment...\nEmail (Required)\nName (Required)\nWebsite\nLoading Comments...\nComment\n×\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

So much of our academic experience is constrained by the need for courses to begin one day and end on another. Thinking explicitly about the areas of overlap (and difference) between a PLN and a course seems fruitful.\nI’ve just finished an online experience which ended with the question “is there something more we can do together to keep this going?” Unfortunately, my schedule didn’t allow me to fully engage with that effort, but your prompt does encourage me to at least check in and see if there’s any way I can still be useful to that potential PLN.\nLeave a Reply to\nJoseph Murphy\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

In particular, his point that “we struggle to know what good teaching and learning looks like in online classes” really resonated with me.  As a trumpet teacher, I cannot expect my students to play with a beautiful sound if they have never head a beautiful trumpet sound before.  As a novice to online teaching and learning experiences, I am seeing for the first time the possibilities of what this can look like, especially when thoughtfully presented as is the case with DigPINS.  I am hearing the music for the first time, so to speak.\nIn this spirit of “small” and  making progress incrementally, I am writing this post.  I have been contemplating the readings and your posts in previous weeks, but have been reluctant to join the conversation.  Part of this is my own inexperience in the digital environment.  However, it makes me wonder about one of Lederman’s assertions that “every student has a voice online”.  As a student, I was always eager to discuss and ask questions in a traditional classroom setting.  But, I am finding I have allowed myself essentially no voice in the written conversation over the last few weeks.  In the same way that we all have certain ways of reaching students who are reluctant participators in a traditional classroom, how can we help students who are reluctant participators in the digital environment?\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nNetworking Week\nNext Post\nDigital pedagogical communities\n(3) Comments\nMiles\nJuly 15, 2019 at 6:02 pm\nReply\nTo me, this relates back to Week 1 and the whole digital identity issue. After more reflection, I’ve found that I keep my identities very separate where any cross-over feels almost uncomfortable or foreign. I wonder if students have traditional classroom identities as well as digital classroom identities, and if they feel uncomfortable using their new identity as well. I also wonder what we as instructors can do to foster a digital classroom identity in our students (some students may have never developed these before as it’s likely different from a digital personal identity).\nReid Riggle\nJuly 15, 2019 at 7:03 pm\nReply\nA very good question.  I don’t have the answer, but I simply try to apply the same principles I would in a face-to-face context.  “Meet students where they are.”  By that I mean learn about them and connect on some individual level.  Teaching is about relationships.  Of course that may mean you need to reveal something of yourself in the process.\nDamien MIchaud\nJuly 16, 2019 at 1:51 pm\nReply\nI find it interesting how online learning can privilege certain participants–and in my experience–it is often those most reluctant to speak up when face to face. I think it might have something to do with a different conception of time. For those learners that are either naturally introverted, or those that take some time to process information, an online discussion can allow them to shine. Whereas in the real time mix of the traditional classroom, they may be less able to jump in.\nYour case is the opposite at this point, but I think that time and experience will lead you to more comfort with the affordances of online interaction.\nLeave a Reply to\nDamien MIchaud\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

And, we might well ask, where else are our names written in this digital age?\nFacebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn? Oh, you don’t do social media! Do you search on google, do you use email, you have and/or read blogs, have you bought anything on line with Amazon prime, Amazon Smile, do you keep abreast of the Daylesford Abbey website, the NYTimes Cooking blog ? If so, your name is written everywhere forever.\nWe all have digital identities. Indeed, we have many. One person’s Buttigieg tweets might well give others a different idea of her than her Richard Rohr daily meditation site or her google searches.\nAnd it’s true for God too. Unfortunately for God, the Creator, Rescuer and Covenant identities got lost in the Satan-inspired and fake judge – blame – condemn website that took over the religious culture of Jesus’ time and is still, sadly, operative among Christians of all varieties.\nIf you get the picture I’m trying to paint then you can understand better why in today’s gospel Jesus has a vision of Satan falling like lightning from the sky. In terms of this homily, Jesus has hacked the hacker and disconnected his Wi-Fi. The seventy disciples sent by Jesus went to heal and bring the peace of God in the face of the sick, diseased and deeply anxious women and men beset with the Satan-the-hacker’s idea that their suffering was a sign of their disconnect from God, that God was punishing them for some wrong doing conscious or unconscious.\nThe disciples’ message of peace and healing without cost released people – and us – from ever thinking that earthquakes, the death of children, the onset of cancer or any other affliction is caused by God, much less be a punishment for sin. That’s the Hacker’s judge / blame / condemn fake news image of God.\nBut, from the beginning and for centuries, God was self-identifying as loving Creator and Rescuer, Protector and, in today’s reading from Isaiah, nurturing Mother. This prophetic image came in a time when God’s People were becoming discouraged and giving up on the rebuilding of Jerusalem after seventy years of exile. But we’re all rebuilding: the world, the nation, our university/college, our family, ourselves.\nThe prophet was calling them and now us to get to know and believe and act out of God’s authentic identity. The paradox is that God can’t be known and authentically identified except through God’s creatures — how we act from what we say we believe. This is why God’s clearest identity is seen in Jesus Christ who sends us to be disciples of peace and healing.\nSo, to return to the beginning and to stretch a point, just as our budgets reveal our values, so our daily words and deeds and even our digital identities (if fully known, God forbid!) speak to us and to others about the identity of God.\nBeware of hackers, beware of the big hacker falling like lightning from the sky!\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nPersonal Librarian Network\nNext Post\nConfronting the Dragon\n(2) Comments\nReid Riggle\nJuly 7, 2019 at 5:34 pm\nReply\nFantastic!

I may have been new to the Faculty Development Committee and our discussion was usually about the risk/reward of implementing new pedagogies. Something along the lines of:\n“I would love to be more innovative in my class, but I am afraid of any negative teacher evaluations that will hamper my prospects for tenure/promotion.” Or…\n“This all sounds interesting, but between teaching and my research I don’t have any time to try something new.”\nNow that I have passed some of those early professional hurdles, and see how quickly technology improves, AND see how my own kids interact with technology at school and at home, it is becoming very clear to me that incorporating digital learning technologies and learning spaces is no longer new or novel, but instead will be considered essential moving forward. I’m not willing to push traditional teaching out on the ice flow, but all this will likely be second nature to the next generation of educators. Do any of you feel the same?

I believe we need a broad conversation on campus calling out the value of innovation for elevating student learning.  We need to craft a system that not only allows for trying new strategies, but gives the faculty member willing to take the chance “credit” if they are able to explain why, what happened, and what they will do next.  In other words, we can create an environment that is conducive to taking, throughtfull, calculated, risks.     The student’s will be the benefit and the institution will thrive.\nPeace,\nReid\nMiles\nJuly 19, 2019 at 2:40 pm\n“We need to craft a system that not only allows for trying new strategies, but gives the faculty member willing to take the chance ‘credit’ if they are able to explain why, what happened, and what they will do next.”\nI love this and totally agree. I was at an institution earlier this summer where everyone, even pre-tenure folks, are actually required to be innovative in the classroom. They are able to do this because of the culture they built and of the safeguards that were put in place to protect from failure. Failure is inevitable, especially when trying new things, and I think that as an institution, we need to accept that and set policies in place to allow for that.\nLeave a Reply to\nReid Riggle\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

A happy little coincidence, I suppose.\nFrustrating as it has drawn my attention to the barrier I encounter each time I get excited about developing my Digital Identity…perfectionism. I do not consider myself a perfectionist. Yet I seem to find just enough wrong with any performance and I am unable to share it out of some form of “posting paralysis”. It seems the only way to deal with it is to jump into the deep end of the pool.

After reading through Seaman’s article, and reading all about how she was able to join these sub-communities and build strong connections with people she never intended on meeting, I was brought back to the early 2010’s when I joined my own online community, the Xbox Live community. Sure I would join random games and play with random people, but I made some friends along the way. For a number of years, I would play with the same group of people, whom I considered to be friends of mine, and I had no idea who they really were. And even though we lacked that actual human connection between each other, we all felt as if we were our own little community. We would all log on at the same time, join a voice-chat party, and play games until the sun came up. As we got older, we all didn’t have as much time and eventually stopped playing together; and even though I never really knew them personally, it still felt like I was turning the page on such a large chapter of my life because of how close I felt to this group of guys. To this day, I still think about some of them and wonder where their life took them after we had played our last game together.\nI’m sure some people (mostly older generations) would be hesitant to call that a “friend group” because we only knew each other by screen names and never even got past where we were from. But I, and I know more people from my generation and younger would back me up on this, wouldn’t doubt for a second that we were all friends. I even see the same thing happening with my younger brothers. I’ve seen them join a random game with a random person and I’ll watch them a couple days later and they’ll still be playing with that same random person. It’s just something about the video game (and others) community that can form such strong bonds between people without either of them having to leave the comfort of their own home.\nAside from the Personal Anecdote\nOne thing I really liked from this week was the Wisdom and/or Madness of Crowds interactive game. Seeing how thoughts and behaviors can spread rapidly reminded me of\nthis video\nfrom CGP Grey which talk about basically the same thing, just not interactive. I would also suggest checking out some of his other videos, they have nothing to do with DigPINS, but I find them very interesting, specifically\nthis one\nabout the future of automation in our world.

I think its interesting to think about that networks built around gaming really got popular and mainstream in probably the last 10 – 15 years, but that’s also around the time-frame that I feel like gaming got legitimized as a hobby or video games recognized as an art form and not just as toys for children.  The rise of online multiplayer gaming and the networking aspect of it probably had a lot do making it a part of the zeitgeist.\nReid\nJuly 11, 2019 at 2:26 pm\nReply\nNate- If we assume that a portion of our students had the same or similar experiences to what you described, what knowledge, skills, preferences do you think these individual bring with them to college?

Time spent on Twitter felt productive and gave me new things to think about and new ways of thinking.\nIn the article entitled, “\nCritical Digital Citizenship: Promoting Empathy and Social Justice Online\n,” Maha Bali reflected, “Even though there is a lot of evidence to the contrary, I believe it (social media) can, if we use it thoughtfully and responsibly. The key, for me, is not in browsing a hashtag randomly, but in getting to know individuals over time, and understanding their contexts and the nuances behind what they tweet and post on their Facebook status, and then also by being thoughtful and intentional about what we ourselves write and share and amplify.”  The write, share, and amplify stood out to me as what I was missing when thinking about Twitter before this week. I thought of it as fluffy, now I better understand the opportunity is so much larger.\nI’m a big fan of\nClifton Strengths\n.  Before this week started, I thought my top five strengths would hinder ability to engage on Twitter but now I see how they will help me.  My top five themes (in order) are Learner, Deliberative, Harmony, Focus, Discipline. (\nDescriptions found here\n).  Without too much detail, I see that my Learner theme is fed by all of the information on this platform.  I hope that Focus and Discipline will help me from falling into rabbit holes and that my Deliberative theme will help me in choosing who to follow (and unfollow) as well as provide a check and balance for a hasty tweet.\nThis week, I reached out to a colleague via Twitter and it resulted in an email from her and a reconnection about work and life.  I also read an article that struck me so I posted it and received one like (I’ll take it) from a former student. I worked to expand my personal learning network and I love being able to follow folks I don’t know and explore their feeds to see if they are sharing great content (passing around the tasty appetizers, to paraphrase Bonnie Stewart). I’m still searching for some role models on Twitter.  Armed with more information, I now know I’m looking for different folks. Previously, I wanted to find folks who were good at using Twitter for their jobs (tweeting about campus events, retweeting photos from campus accounts, etc) and now I know I’m looking for folks who are talking about important issues and making their presence known and valued.\nI will continue to explore Twitter and make connections with “my people” to keep current on issues in student affairs, service-learning, and community engagement as well as other areas of interest.\nBtw, you can follow me on Twitter @jnissenphd\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nNetwork Node or Dead End?\nNext Post\nInterdisciplinary Digital Pedagogies\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

One thing I’ve been researching lately are brand communities, or how people form relationships with other consumers based on using a particular brand. For example, I’m a huge beer geek and joined a membership club for a brewery in the middle of nowhere Colorado. I’d go up every few months to pick up bottles and hang out with the brewer and other members. It was always a blast and I made friends with other members because of it. These communities have a lot of value to a company, but I wonder if they can be applied to digital pedagogy to get similar benefits. To me, this seems like a process similar to one we’d need to cultivate the learning environments that we hope to achieve in online classes.\nBelow are 4 principles of building brand communities (adapted from Fournier & Lee, 2009) that I think might transfer to building digital pedagogical communities. I’d love to get your thoughts!\n1) Strong brands (classrooms) arise from the right community structure – not vice versa. The strongest, most stable structures for a class would be one whose affiliations are based on close one-to-one connections, and so as instructors we should try to provide opportunities for members to forge many interpersonal links.\n2) Brand communities (classrooms) thrive on conflict and contrast – not love. By creating a sense of contrast (i.e., defining out-groups), conflict, and boundaries, it could strengthen group unity. I could see this being applied to some group activities (but definitely not all), or maybe framing the class to be against some non-real group?\n3) Communities (classrooms) are strongest when all members – not just opinion leaders – have strong roles. Everyone in the class needs to play a value-adding role (i.e., everyone needs to participate and try to be a part of the community). This can likely be done by setting up various assignments in the class.\n4) Online social networks (e.g., LMSs) are only a tool – not your community strategy. The online learning management systems should facilitate interactions and should be a tool to support classroom needs.\nWhat do you all think? Any of those seem wrong? Anything not included that you think should be? I’d love to hear your thoughts!\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nSmall Teaching/Big Learning\nNext Post\nReflections of Week 3 (in the middle of Week 4)\n(4) Comments\nReid Riggle\nJuly 15, 2019 at 6:31 pm\nReply\nAn interesting idea.  I am struggling a bit with the second point.  I would need to hear what is meant by “conflict.”   Contrast seems to be much more realistic.  If we are talking about the value of debating different perspectives as “conflict,” I see value there.  The discourse over ideas can help  to create new insights and resolutions can build a common understanding which could foster community.  But your beer example does not seem to have this quality.   Tell us more about this idea.\nMiles\nJuly 15, 2019 at 7:14 pm\nReply\nI think you’re right that contrast is more relevant for digital pedagogical communities, though conflict is similar (but a bit more extreme) to me. Conflict also relies on the idea of in-grouping and out-grouping, and that feeling apart of an ingroup is going to make you feel a stronger connection with others in that ingroup. There’s a lot of cool research about how just being part of a group makes you feel closer with others in your group (even if you were just randomly assigned to that group). In my brewery example, there is a sense of being part of an exclusive group that is distinct from other beer drinkers and other beer club members (e.g., people talking smack about another similar brewery in the Facebook group).\nIn my mind, the idea here would be to somehow set up the classroom in order to make everyone in it feel like they are part of a ingroup. I could see this process happening a few ways, with all basically revolving around your idea about seeing the value of debating different perspectives. Concretely, it could be setting up an activity that pits the class or groups against an idea (e.g., maybe an outdated theory that is only right in some situations so the students have to tear it apart as a class) or the class vs a devil’s advocate (likely the instructor – I had an instructor do this very well in college) about some relevant topic. I could also see it working as having many debates in the class where students are assigned so they work with everyone else at least once (this would be more difficult to set up but perhaps more engaging for everyone). I think it could take a lot of forms, but having a theoretical foundation could be easier in figuring out what those forms might take in the classroom.\nAlso, I should have said that don’t necessarily see a 1:1 carryover between brand communities and classroom communities – I just think there might be some insights from other relevant domains.\nalaina\nJuly 16, 2019 at 3:11 pm\nReply\nI especially like #2. I’ve been thinking a lot about growthful conflict and how we embrace/enable conflict in our work environment to create bonds. It is all about establishing a team mentality–I think back to being on sports teams in school and how quickly/easily it was to form a bond with my teammates because it was us against them. I like the idea of moving away from love as the centering force, especially in a classroom or work environment. What else can we unite over?? Great points.\nMiles\nJuly 16, 2019 at 3:26 pm\nDefinitely! I had the same experience with high school sports. I think the thing to watch out for as an instructor is making sure you manage the conflict appropriately, bc the flip side to this is that if someone is seen as an outgroup member by the class, then students won’t respond positively or productively to that person. So it’s vital that other students are not seen as outgroups, or that if they are, they are quickly rotated back into the ingroup (e.g., via continuously switching groups for debates).\nLeave a Reply to\nMiles\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

I know that people are on the web for lots of different reasons but I never like to assume that someone is on because they want to be. I know sometimes people have to be on for work or for school. I sometimes find posts that I would love to tweet out or otherwise amplify but I always hesitate if the author is not amplifying themselves. Maybe I’m overthinking it but I always wonder if they would appreciate the amplification but are just afraid of self-promoting themselves.

Among other things, I was to dive into Twitter and become more of a resident to develop a personal learning network. In keeping with the Ron Swanson gifs, my first thought was:\nBefore I go on, I’ll say that tweeting and exploring networks wasn’t bad. My wife says I can be a bit of a curmudgeon so I blocked out any notions I had about Twitter and dove in. I’m most interested in applying these lessons to improving my teaching and I have enjoyed having the student perspective. I think most thought-provoking was the Nicky Case narrative game The Wisdom and/or Madness of Crowds which got me thinking about what kind of “node” I am and what I should be. I signed up for Twitter, started following some people, and immediately my feed was filled with tweets and suggestions on who to follow. Though I was only following a few people, it was easy to start seeing information flowing from so many different networks of people. Social justice issues, cutting edge research, personal posts, news. and politics. Several have commented on how twitter can be overwhelming at first and I would agree. Trying to manage the flood of information and sift through the useless information to find the useful is difficult. I looked a lot at twitter profiles for professional organizations and would follow them and check out the suggested pages. My feed quickly turned into an echo-chamber with highly similar information bouncing around. I followed new people in very different areas and the feed changed. So after a week I developed a massive following… nine people, and I think all of them are in the #DigPINS group. So what information do I share? I had to consider my “audience” and what information they might care about or find useful. Clearly posting something about a highly technical article is a poor choice. An inspirational quote maybe? A selfie? I settled on re-tweeting from some of the organizations I followed – try to move information from my personal learning network into a network of people that aren’t biologists studying conservation or zoonotic diseases. Perhaps I could use my role as an expert to promote that info. Huzzah, I am a Twitter resident!\nI am no stranger to networks. I have heavily relied on different personal networks to advance my career and conduct research. However, I hadn’t really considered my digital network until this week. In a lot of ways I am a digital dead end. Information flows to me and stops unless I email or instant message a link directly to someone. I can see how engaging more on a platform like Twitter could be a way to expand my reach to students and funnel things I learn about to them. I could use this as a way to reach students outside of the classroom and beyond the one semester I may have with them. Looks like I have a lot of work to do on my digital network.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nMy two Twitters\nNext Post\nLearning, Networking, and Connecting\n(1) Comment\nJennifer Nissen\nJuly 8, 2018 at 8:34 pm\nReply\nAdam,  I feel like a digital dead end, too.

The instrument I play, the bass trombone, rarely gets the spotlight. The best gig I ever had was as a member of the Arizona Opera Orchestra and I loved it in no small part because I could do my job in the orchestra pit while all the action was on the stage above me. I often compare playing the bass trombone to being an offensive lineman in football…if I’m doing my job correctly you won’t really notice. If I screw up (i.e. allow a career ending sack of the star quarterback) then you’ll know I’m there and I may have ruined your fantasy football season.\nI have a public face…Director of the Music Department, Director of the SNC Jazz Ensemble, instructor of a few relatively popular music-themed Core Curriculum courses…but I am not terribly comfortable trumpeting my professional accomplishments out into the world.\nAnd unfortunately, in my line of work I need to “sell” myself (and my work) more than I am confortable with. I need to sell myself to the members of the personnel committee for promotion. Sell myself to my colleagues in Faculty Development when I apply for funding to travel and perform. Sell myself to peers at other institutions to see if they are interested in having me share my work with their students. I would much rather be the type of musician that consistently plays at a high level and goes about her/his business without interruption.\nSo I am approaching the DigPins project with some enthusiasm, hoping it will:\nTeach me some skills for easily managing my professional online identity, and\nMotivate me to begin a few of the ideas I have been carrying with me for some time, waiting for the right opportunity.\nThank you for reading about my own little neurosis.

In my case, when I post something on social media, a majority of my audience knows me personally,  making it is easier for them to interpret my post as I intended. My goal when posting online is to have someone read it and think, “I can picture him saying this,” or, “This is\nexactly\nsomething he would say.” With the start of DigPINS and seeing all these new faces, I figured rather than try to express my thoughts and ideas in writing, I would do something a little different\nNathaniel Cadotte\nNo subscribers\nSubscribe\nDigPINS Vlog 1\nWatch later\nShare\nCopy link\nInfo\nShopping\nTap to unmute\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\nYou're signed out\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

I have a presence online, but doubt anyone consistently looks at it.  I have found that I engage more readily with social media sites, such as Face book, twitter, Instagram, Tik Tok, etc.  I usually have a picture that I comment on, rather than a written blog post.  Mostly, responses are from a small circle of friends rather than a large group of strangers.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\n2\nbloggers\nlike this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nNecessity is the mother of invention\nNext Post\nThoughts on Digital Identity\n(4) Comments\nAutumm\nJune 2, 2020 at 5:49 pm\nReply\nNodding from over here Tom.\nNetworks are tricky things.

Breaking into a new network is hard and often does not come without you putting yourself out there a bit. We will talk more about networks next week.\nTaylor\nJune 3, 2020 at 3:11 am\nReply\nI think using online platforms for the small group interactions can be a good thing too. I tweet, and post on Instagram, but don’t have much of an audience there, its really just to share things with my small circle. I have a blog site that I write on somewhat infrequently, but the main audience for that site is really myself! Its just a place to write about things I am interested in at the time.\nKrissy Lukens\nJune 3, 2020 at 2:48 pm\nReply\nNodding Tom! One of the things I love about #DigPINS is that it is an entrance into beginning to create a new network, as Autumm mentions. Not always easy, but I’m so grateful for the people I’ve met through participation in this online experience. Like Taylor, my blogging (which I don’t do that often) has become more for me, which actually makes it a lot easier. Like you, I use a variety of social platforms for different purposes, and have ebbs and flows on my frequency of use.

One thing I’ve been researching lately are brand communities, or how people form relationships with other consumers based on using a particular brand. For example, I’m a huge beer geek and joined a membership club for a brewery in the middle of nowhere Colorado. I’d go up every few months to pick up bottles and hang out with the brewer and other members. It was always a blast and I made friends with other members because of it. These communities have a lot of value to a company, but I wonder if they can be applied to digital pedagogy to get similar benefits. To me, this seems like a process similar to one we’d need to cultivate the learning environments that we hope to achieve in online classes.\nBelow are 4 principles of building brand communities (adapted from Fournier & Lee, 2009) that I think might transfer to building digital pedagogical communities. I’d love to get your thoughts!\n1) Strong brands (classrooms) arise from the right community structure – not vice versa. The strongest, most stable structures for a class would be one whose affiliations are based on close one-to-one connections, and so as instructors we should try to provide opportunities for members to forge many interpersonal links.\n2) Brand communities (classrooms) thrive on conflict and contrast – not love. By creating a sense of contrast (i.e., defining out-groups), conflict, and boundaries, it could strengthen group unity. I could see this being applied to some group activities (but definitely not all), or maybe framing the class to be against some non-real group?\n3) Communities (classrooms) are strongest when all members – not just opinion leaders – have strong roles. Everyone in the class needs to play a value-adding role (i.e., everyone needs to participate and try to be a part of the community). This can likely be done by setting up various assignments in the class.\n4) Online social networks (e.g., LMSs) are only a tool – not your community strategy. The online learning management systems should facilitate interactions and should be a tool to support classroom needs.\nWhat do you all think? Any of those seem wrong? Anything not included that you think should be? I’d love to hear your thoughts!\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nSmall Teaching/Big Learning\nNext Post\nReflections of Week 3 (in the middle of Week 4)\n(4) Comments\nReid Riggle\nJuly 15, 2019 at 6:31 pm\nReply\nAn interesting idea.  I am struggling a bit with the second point.  I would need to hear what is meant by “conflict.”   Contrast seems to be much more realistic.  If we are talking about the value of debating different perspectives as “conflict,” I see value there.  The discourse over ideas can help  to create new insights and resolutions can build a common understanding which could foster community.  But your beer example does not seem to have this quality.   Tell us more about this idea.\nMiles\nJuly 15, 2019 at 7:14 pm\nReply\nI think you’re right that contrast is more relevant for digital pedagogical communities, though conflict is similar (but a bit more extreme) to me. Conflict also relies on the idea of in-grouping and out-grouping, and that feeling apart of an ingroup is going to make you feel a stronger connection with others in that ingroup. There’s a lot of cool research about how just being part of a group makes you feel closer with others in your group (even if you were just randomly assigned to that group). In my brewery example, there is a sense of being part of an exclusive group that is distinct from other beer drinkers and other beer club members (e.g., people talking smack about another similar brewery in the Facebook group).\nIn my mind, the idea here would be to somehow set up the classroom in order to make everyone in it feel like they are part of a ingroup. I could see this process happening a few ways, with all basically revolving around your idea about seeing the value of debating different perspectives. Concretely, it could be setting up an activity that pits the class or groups against an idea (e.g., maybe an outdated theory that is only right in some situations so the students have to tear it apart as a class) or the class vs a devil’s advocate (likely the instructor – I had an instructor do this very well in college) about some relevant topic. I could also see it working as having many debates in the class where students are assigned so they work with everyone else at least once (this would be more difficult to set up but perhaps more engaging for everyone). I think it could take a lot of forms, but having a theoretical foundation could be easier in figuring out what those forms might take in the classroom.\nAlso, I should have said that don’t necessarily see a 1:1 carryover between brand communities and classroom communities – I just think there might be some insights from other relevant domains.\nalaina\nJuly 16, 2019 at 3:11 pm\nReply\nI especially like #2. I’ve been thinking a lot about growthful conflict and how we embrace/enable conflict in our work environment to create bonds. It is all about establishing a team mentality–I think back to being on sports teams in school and how quickly/easily it was to form a bond with my teammates because it was us against them. I like the idea of moving away from love as the centering force, especially in a classroom or work environment. What else can we unite over?? Great points.\nMiles\nJuly 16, 2019 at 3:26 pm\nDefinitely! I had the same experience with high school sports. I think the thing to watch out for as an instructor is making sure you manage the conflict appropriately, bc the flip side to this is that if someone is seen as an outgroup member by the class, then students won’t respond positively or productively to that person. So it’s vital that other students are not seen as outgroups, or that if they are, they are quickly rotated back into the ingroup (e.g., via continuously switching groups for debates).\nLeave a Reply to\nReid Riggle\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

At the suggestion of fellow DigPiners, I recently started using Tweet Deck to try to manage this traffic and start categorizing and making sense of everything that is flying by. However, volume of traffic has not been my only adjustment and what has been more significant to how I use Twitter is that I now have two Twitter user behaviors to manage. My longtime Twitter feed has gone from a feed of one-liner joke-tweets, fan boy interests, and updates on current events (5-10 minutes of scrolling and the occasional reading past the headline. Terrible. I know.) to one filled with more professional content and comments that require much more attention and investment than the Twitter and the Twitter user behavior that I am used to (I now have to stop and read?? And think??). I have found that I do not like crossing my personal and professional streams and seem to get distracted when they mix and force me to move from one user behavior to the other. I just started using Tweet Deck to further categorize tweets based on the author so that I can visually create these two streams and decide which version of Twitter and Twitter user behavior I want to engage in.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nAn atmosphere of growth\nNext Post\nNetwork Node or Dead End?\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

Within the course, students learn about social scientific research, which also addresses core curriculum goals. One of the key formative assessments in the course is a series of reading guides that teach students about the topic of the week and how to understand empirical articles.\nThe way I conducted these assignments in previous semesters was by giving students a Word document, which they downloaded, filled out, and then uploaded to Moodle. After the assignment was turned in, I graded them in Moodle and we discussed the answers in class.\nThere were a few issues that I aimed to solve by redesigning the assignment. Some students inappropriately collaborated or copied from former students. Other students copied and pasted directly from the article rather than putting things in their own words (despite instructions to the contrary). Not only do these instances violate standards of academic integrity, but they undercut student learning. In addition, I suspected that I could enhance student learning by providing a more guided experience, especially early in the semester.\nWith these goals in mind, I looked for solutions across a variety of platforms, focusing on those that would easily integrate with Moodle. Ultimately, I hit upon two formats that I implemented during the semester, Google Forms and Google Assignments. Below is a summary of how each of these worked for my purposes as well as some of the pros and cons related to each that may be helpful to other instructors.\nPhase 1: Google Forms\nFor the first few, I created reading guides in Google Forms that had  multiple pages, each one focused on a particular aspect of the reading. On the article itself, I added different color stars that I then added to corresponding questions. I encouraged them to use these to learn about the structure of empirical articles.\nRather than sending students the Google Form to complete, I embedded it in a Moodle assignment. (This is easily accomplished by copying the embed code provided by Google and pasting it into the assignment description as html.) This way, the reading guide appeared in Moodle just like any other assignment with the article attached.\nPros\nStudents are familiar with Google Forms and with the form available in Moodle virtually no technical support was needed.\nThe Form provided a clear step-by-step process for students to follow.\nThe Form gave students some idea of how much text was expected for each prompt.\nCons\nStudents had to complete the whole assignment in one sitting. Google Forms doesn’t provide the option of saving your progress, and a few students reported that it timed out before they were able to submit their work.\nGrading had to be completed using Moodle in one window and Google Forms in another.\nPhase 2: Google Assignments\nFor the later reading guides, I used Google Assignments. First, I created a Google Doc version of the reading guide. Then I created a Google Assignment in Moodle. The assignment description contained two links, a link to the article and a link to the reading guide with the instruction to “make a copy” of it. This way each student had their own copy of the reading guide as a Google Doc.\nPros\nOriginality reports are fantastic. At a glance you can see each instance of unoriginal text. The student can see the same when they submit their assignment and make revisions before the due date.\nCommenting is easy, and comments are pushed to students. As with Moodle, you can create a bank of commonly used comments.\nGrades are automatically pushed to the Moodle gradebook.\nCons\nStudents may need a bit of coaching on how to use Google Assignments, and with an instructor view very different from the student view, students often have to rely on each other or ITS for technical support.\nGrading is relatively slow. There’s a bit of processing that takes place between each student.\nGoogle Assignments don’t always load properly in Moodle. The most common issue is that they appear in a very small window, which the user has to try and scroll within to open the assignment.\nGoogle Assignment deadlines are not added to the Moodle course calendar.\nProject Assessment\nI thought both versions of this assignment were superior to my previous iterations. The academic integrity issues I previously noted all but disappeared, presumably because the formats were more difficult to share and discouraged copying and pasting. Additionally, in my estimation the quality of students’ work increased over prior semesters, which reflects enhanced understanding of  how knowledge is created in media psychology.\nI also solicited students’ feedback on the assignments. The vast majority of the 28 students agreed or strongly agreed with the statement that the reading guides helped them better understand social scientific articles. In terms of format, most students (54%) preferred the Google Doc version, some preferred the Google Form (28%), and a few had no preference (18%).\nLooking Ahead\nI don’t plan to use Google Forms again for reading guides because the Google Assignments were better in both my opinion and most students’. However, I have and will continue to use embedded Google Forms for other things. For example, during this semester of remote learning, I have used them to replicate in-class activities.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nBack to the Future … er, … Past\nNext Post\nMy Journey with #digPINS…Round 2!\n(3) Comments\nSusan Ashley\nApril 27, 2020 at 10:03 pm\nReply\nValerie,\nIt’s been my pleasure collaborating with you. I’ve enjoyed discussing ideas as you tried new ways to reach objectives for your course. Your blog reflection with comparisons for Google Forms and Google Assignments for your reading guide assignments could be very useful to others as they try to choose between the two tools when looking at their particular objectives.  Quick question, when referring back to the Bryn Mawr Digital Competencies Framework, which skills align with your implementation of this initiative?\nValerie\nMay 6, 2020 at 3:13 pm\nGood question! Under “critical making, design, and development,” item 5.4 is digital research and scholarship. This project helped students become “aware of both traditional and emerging processes of knowledge creation and dissemination in a particular discipline,” in this case the discipline of Media Psychology. The project also required students to engage in “digital communication,” especially 2.1 collaborative communication.\nKrissy Lukens\nAugust 7, 2020 at 3:10 pm\nReply\nValerie – since going paperless is something that is increasingly more important, I’m curious if you will continue to use this method this coming fall.

Shan’s time limit and Katie’s pomodoro suggestions are highly appreciated. I’m definitely going to take them into account as I continue exploring week 2’s dig. networks. In addition, I also find the recommended videos/readings extremely useful. Alison Seaman’s article is particularly interesting because it addresses ICTs, PLEs and PKM, which I’m certain will assist me in developing a strong currency in PLNs. Some of the key ideas are when she describes how digital isolation is a product of technical skills and an understanding of the social elements online. When used efficiently, PLN entails digital responsibility for two main reasons: 1) to have a sense of self-direction to work as required to develop one’s own digital and web literacies; and 2) to improve mutual learning which is based on trusting reciprocity. That is, a self-assessment is required to learn and share within networks. As someone who advocates for diversity, I am pleased to learn that a PLN avoids becoming an “echo chamber” while promoting global digital diversification.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nNetworking Process – How I use Twitter\nNext Post\nAn atmosphere of growth\n(2) Comments\nReid\nJuly 3, 2018 at 5:15 pm\nReply\nIt is valuable to have a window into your thinking.

The class was truly special for me in a number of ways: 1) it was my first time\nteaching a hybrid class\nthat takes place both online and in person, 2) I got to try out a topic I love with\nadvanced students\nwho were equally fired up about it, and 3) the hybrid nature of the course was uniquely supportive of my early months of mothering a tiny person (who arrived at the end of the fall semester). The course gave me a purposeful connection to the college community I love while allowing me to keep a schedule that centered around the un-circadian rhythms of a newborn.\nSaid newborn and one of 28 small gouache paintings I did parallel to this class as part of #\nsketchuary\n.\nBelow I’m going to briefly outline the structure and weekly rhythm of our course in case you, like I, have never taught an online or hybrid course and don’t have a sense of what that means practically.\nIn our class we primarily used two platforms to host our work:\nslack\n, a free, private, group workspace for sharing messages, images, links, informal thoughts, and other work-in-progress (#WIP); and\nart389.katieries.com\n, a public website hosted as a subdomain on my personal site* and running WordPress. All students in the class were added to our slack team and were given user/author accounts for the WordPress site. Prior to the start of the semester, I stocked the class site with posts making up the content of the syllabus.\nI also posted the syllabus as a straight multipage PDF\nfor those (like me) who prefer their content a little more linear than the branching structure of a website. Students also got a Premium subscription to\nSkillShare\n, a website with thousands of curated and edited tutorial videos on creative techniques and concepts. I also asked students to set up a website through the college’s Domains program and to think about what, if any, work they wanted to post there. They were required to create an online illustration portfolio on their own domains as part of the final.\n* –  Side note: I learned I had not talked enough about formatting images for the web when my 14 students each uploaded files ranging from 1-2 MB and my hosting data got all but used up. Should have brushed up on my  “\nDigital Survival Skills\n” from Bryn Mawr’s Digital Competencies Framework.\nWe worked on four projects during the semester:\nan introductory assignment\nexploring gouache and our artist identities, a\nsurface design\nproject, an\neditorial illustration project\n, and a\nfinal self-directed project\nwith online portfolio. For the first three projects, I assigned students videos to watch on SkillShare, short essays to read and reflect on, and progress work to post to slack. We would post our work-in-progress and respond to one another on slack. We would meet in person at least once-a-project to touch base, critique work, or Skype with freelance illustrators. (Shout out to\nLauren Lowen\nand\nSam’s Myth\nfor being so thoughtful and generous with their time.) The bulk of our communication was online, but our final critiques were often in person.\nSam Smith, AKA Sam’s Myth talking with our class about his work\nIn thinking about what worked and what didn’t for this class, it is impossible for me to separate out the strands of the hybrid structure, the newness of teaching illustration, and the weird contracting time of early baby days. The things that I loved about the course, like the flexible schedule and giving asynchronous feedback, where also the things many students mentioned liking. Thankfully, some of the things I worried about didn’t show up as much in student feedback. I had been concerned that the lack of in-person lectures and relying on SkillShare for content might seem to students like I wasn’t delivering the goods in terms of What Teachers Do. Instead, SkillShare was an ideal platform for accommodating a variety of software preferences and levels of experience. Motivated and curious students could geek out on learning more advanced techniques. Less engaged students could speed through the tutorial videos at double speed. Or skip them entirely.\nIn proposing the course, I suggested that our digital communications would be akin to the back and forth of an art director and a freelance illustrator. The “digital” here is a feature, not a bug. While I personally missed the ability to “read the room” and to respond to cues in people’s body language and tone of voice, for the most part we had rich and constructive communication. Our group met face-to-face around six times over the semester. I think both students and I were grateful for our face-to-face check ins. In an in-person critique, we could deliver impactful feedback and answer an artist’s specific questions. While the asynchronous feedback we gave on slack was nice in that people could tend to it when they chose to, in-person feedback helps when the deadline is tight or when dialogue and questioning can be helpful to your process.\nAnother gouache painting for #\nsketchuary\nWere I to teach a hybrid course again, I’d want to spend some more time working with students to articulate, and set expectations for, what it looks like to have “good classroom community” online. At the recent D3 conference at SNC, speaker\nMartha Burtis\ntalked about the importance of letting students teach each other. Now I’m thinking about how I could better use the systems of our class (slack, email, and our WordPress site) to encourage and facilitate peer teaching. Similarly, this class was my first time testing out some of\nJesse Stommel’s ideas on “ungrading.”\nI am convinced that quantitative grades are not helpful in pushing students to make better art. Our foray into ungraded-ness was a little messy, but good.  I’m excited to fine tune the process such that I will be comfortable using it with first-year and beginning students.\nI’m grateful to have had the opportunity to teach Illustration, to try out a hybrid course, and to keep a foot in the world of the classroom while I tended the home fires of the new human.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nMy #DigPINS experience\nNext Post\n#DigPINS Project\n(2) Comments\nKrissy Lukens\nMay 29, 2019 at 1:15 pm\nReply\nSo fun to read how #DigPINS helped shape some of your course, and how some takeaways from D3 will be meaningful for future iterations!

Within the course, students learn about social scientific research, which also addresses core curriculum goals. One of the key formative assessments in the course is a series of reading guides that teach students about the topic of the week and how to understand empirical articles.\nThe way I conducted these assignments in previous semesters was by giving students a Word document, which they downloaded, filled out, and then uploaded to Moodle. After the assignment was turned in, I graded them in Moodle and we discussed the answers in class.\nThere were a few issues that I aimed to solve by redesigning the assignment. Some students inappropriately collaborated or copied from former students. Other students copied and pasted directly from the article rather than putting things in their own words (despite instructions to the contrary). Not only do these instances violate standards of academic integrity, but they undercut student learning. In addition, I suspected that I could enhance student learning by providing a more guided experience, especially early in the semester.\nWith these goals in mind, I looked for solutions across a variety of platforms, focusing on those that would easily integrate with Moodle. Ultimately, I hit upon two formats that I implemented during the semester, Google Forms and Google Assignments. Below is a summary of how each of these worked for my purposes as well as some of the pros and cons related to each that may be helpful to other instructors.\nPhase 1: Google Forms\nFor the first few, I created reading guides in Google Forms that had  multiple pages, each one focused on a particular aspect of the reading. On the article itself, I added different color stars that I then added to corresponding questions. I encouraged them to use these to learn about the structure of empirical articles.\nRather than sending students the Google Form to complete, I embedded it in a Moodle assignment. (This is easily accomplished by copying the embed code provided by Google and pasting it into the assignment description as html.) This way, the reading guide appeared in Moodle just like any other assignment with the article attached.\nPros\nStudents are familiar with Google Forms and with the form available in Moodle virtually no technical support was needed.\nThe Form provided a clear step-by-step process for students to follow.\nThe Form gave students some idea of how much text was expected for each prompt.\nCons\nStudents had to complete the whole assignment in one sitting. Google Forms doesn’t provide the option of saving your progress, and a few students reported that it timed out before they were able to submit their work.\nGrading had to be completed using Moodle in one window and Google Forms in another.\nPhase 2: Google Assignments\nFor the later reading guides, I used Google Assignments. First, I created a Google Doc version of the reading guide. Then I created a Google Assignment in Moodle. The assignment description contained two links, a link to the article and a link to the reading guide with the instruction to “make a copy” of it. This way each student had their own copy of the reading guide as a Google Doc.\nPros\nOriginality reports are fantastic. At a glance you can see each instance of unoriginal text. The student can see the same when they submit their assignment and make revisions before the due date.\nCommenting is easy, and comments are pushed to students. As with Moodle, you can create a bank of commonly used comments.\nGrades are automatically pushed to the Moodle gradebook.\nCons\nStudents may need a bit of coaching on how to use Google Assignments, and with an instructor view very different from the student view, students often have to rely on each other or ITS for technical support.\nGrading is relatively slow. There’s a bit of processing that takes place between each student.\nGoogle Assignments don’t always load properly in Moodle. The most common issue is that they appear in a very small window, which the user has to try and scroll within to open the assignment.\nGoogle Assignment deadlines are not added to the Moodle course calendar.\nProject Assessment\nI thought both versions of this assignment were superior to my previous iterations. The academic integrity issues I previously noted all but disappeared, presumably because the formats were more difficult to share and discouraged copying and pasting. Additionally, in my estimation the quality of students’ work increased over prior semesters, which reflects enhanced understanding of  how knowledge is created in media psychology.\nI also solicited students’ feedback on the assignments. The vast majority of the 28 students agreed or strongly agreed with the statement that the reading guides helped them better understand social scientific articles. In terms of format, most students (54%) preferred the Google Doc version, some preferred the Google Form (28%), and a few had no preference (18%).\nLooking Ahead\nI don’t plan to use Google Forms again for reading guides because the Google Assignments were better in both my opinion and most students’. However, I have and will continue to use embedded Google Forms for other things. For example, during this semester of remote learning, I have used them to replicate in-class activities.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nBack to the Future … er, … Past\nNext Post\nMy Journey with #digPINS…Round 2!\n(3) Comments\nSusan Ashley\nApril 27, 2020 at 10:03 pm\nReply\nValerie,\nIt’s been my pleasure collaborating with you. I’ve enjoyed discussing ideas as you tried new ways to reach objectives for your course. Your blog reflection with comparisons for Google Forms and Google Assignments for your reading guide assignments could be very useful to others as they try to choose between the two tools when looking at their particular objectives.  Quick question, when referring back to the Bryn Mawr Digital Competencies Framework, which skills align with your implementation of this initiative?\nValerie\nMay 6, 2020 at 3:13 pm\nGood question! Under “critical making, design, and development,” item 5.4 is digital research and scholarship. This project helped students become “aware of both traditional and emerging processes of knowledge creation and dissemination in a particular discipline,” in this case the discipline of Media Psychology. The project also required students to engage in “digital communication,” especially 2.1 collaborative communication.\nKrissy Lukens\nAugust 7, 2020 at 3:10 pm\nReply\nValerie – since going paperless is something that is increasingly more important, I’m curious if you will continue to use this method this coming fall. In re-reading your blog post, could the Tech Bar help in any way, in supporting students using the Google Assignments tool?\nLeave a Reply to\nKrissy Lukens\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

One thing I’ve been researching lately are brand communities, or how people form relationships with other consumers based on using a particular brand. For example, I’m a huge beer geek and joined a membership club for a brewery in the middle of nowhere Colorado. I’d go up every few months to pick up bottles and hang out with the brewer and other members. It was always a blast and I made friends with other members because of it. These communities have a lot of value to a company, but I wonder if they can be applied to digital pedagogy to get similar benefits. To me, this seems like a process similar to one we’d need to cultivate the learning environments that we hope to achieve in online classes.\nBelow are 4 principles of building brand communities (adapted from Fournier & Lee, 2009) that I think might transfer to building digital pedagogical communities. I’d love to get your thoughts!\n1) Strong brands (classrooms) arise from the right community structure – not vice versa. The strongest, most stable structures for a class would be one whose affiliations are based on close one-to-one connections, and so as instructors we should try to provide opportunities for members to forge many interpersonal links.\n2) Brand communities (classrooms) thrive on conflict and contrast – not love. By creating a sense of contrast (i.e., defining out-groups), conflict, and boundaries, it could strengthen group unity. I could see this being applied to some group activities (but definitely not all), or maybe framing the class to be against some non-real group?\n3) Communities (classrooms) are strongest when all members – not just opinion leaders – have strong roles. Everyone in the class needs to play a value-adding role (i.e., everyone needs to participate and try to be a part of the community). This can likely be done by setting up various assignments in the class.\n4) Online social networks (e.g., LMSs) are only a tool – not your community strategy. The online learning management systems should facilitate interactions and should be a tool to support classroom needs.\nWhat do you all think? Any of those seem wrong? Anything not included that you think should be? I’d love to hear your thoughts!\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nSmall Teaching/Big Learning\nNext Post\nReflections of Week 3 (in the middle of Week 4)\n(4) Comments\nReid Riggle\nJuly 15, 2019 at 6:31 pm\nReply\nAn interesting idea.  I am struggling a bit with the second point.  I would need to hear what is meant by “conflict.”   Contrast seems to be much more realistic.  If we are talking about the value of debating different perspectives as “conflict,” I see value there.  The discourse over ideas can help  to create new insights and resolutions can build a common understanding which could foster community.  But your beer example does not seem to have this quality.   Tell us more about this idea.\nMiles\nJuly 15, 2019 at 7:14 pm\nReply\nI think you’re right that contrast is more relevant for digital pedagogical communities, though conflict is similar (but a bit more extreme) to me. Conflict also relies on the idea of in-grouping and out-grouping, and that feeling apart of an ingroup is going to make you feel a stronger connection with others in that ingroup. There’s a lot of cool research about how just being part of a group makes you feel closer with others in your group (even if you were just randomly assigned to that group). In my brewery example, there is a sense of being part of an exclusive group that is distinct from other beer drinkers and other beer club members (e.g., people talking smack about another similar brewery in the Facebook group).\nIn my mind, the idea here would be to somehow set up the classroom in order to make everyone in it feel like they are part of a ingroup. I could see this process happening a few ways, with all basically revolving around your idea about seeing the value of debating different perspectives. Concretely, it could be setting up an activity that pits the class or groups against an idea (e.g., maybe an outdated theory that is only right in some situations so the students have to tear it apart as a class) or the class vs a devil’s advocate (likely the instructor – I had an instructor do this very well in college) about some relevant topic. I could also see it working as having many debates in the class where students are assigned so they work with everyone else at least once (this would be more difficult to set up but perhaps more engaging for everyone). I think it could take a lot of forms, but having a theoretical foundation could be easier in figuring out what those forms might take in the classroom.\nAlso, I should have said that don’t necessarily see a 1:1 carryover between brand communities and classroom communities – I just think there might be some insights from other relevant domains.\nalaina\nJuly 16, 2019 at 3:11 pm\nReply\nI especially like #2. I’ve been thinking a lot about growthful conflict and how we embrace/enable conflict in our work environment to create bonds. It is all about establishing a team mentality–I think back to being on sports teams in school and how quickly/easily it was to form a bond with my teammates because it was us against them. I like the idea of moving away from love as the centering force, especially in a classroom or work environment. What else can we unite over?? Great points.\nMiles\nJuly 16, 2019 at 3:26 pm\nDefinitely! I had the same experience with high school sports. I think the thing to watch out for as an instructor is making sure you manage the conflict appropriately, bc the flip side to this is that if someone is seen as an outgroup member by the class, then students won’t respond positively or productively to that person. So it’s vital that other students are not seen as outgroups, or that if they are, they are quickly rotated back into the ingroup (e.g., via continuously switching groups for debates).\nLeave a Reply to\nalaina\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

Meh… #DigPINS and Digital Lab Notebooks – SNC #DigPINS","text":"Home\n>\nBlog\n>\nImplementation Report\n>\nPANDEMIC!?! Meh… #DigPINS and Digital Lab Notebooks\nIn these unprecedented times… this significant event in our history… this once in a lifetime pandemic… did I miss any other cliche openings to reference the mess that this semester turned into? I may be speaking to the choir (now meeting\nvirtually\nas singing spreads respiratory droplets), but participating in #DigPINS has made this transition to distance learning not nearly as jarring as others may have experienced. I was already prepared for delivering content online via Google Meets, students turn in PDF copies of their work in Moodle, and the text is an OER (\nOpenStax\n) available freely online. Teaching a lab based course though did present a challenge – how do you provide practical hands on experiences that students need for careers in the sciences? Spring break was coming and the rumblings were starting that we wouldn’t come back to campus right away, or at all. We were finishing our biodiversity module and still had some dissections left to complete that were originally scheduled for the weeks after break. I did consider sending them home with a fetal pig to dissect but the logistics just didn’t work out in time.\nSetting Up a Digital Lab Notebook\nIf I can look at the bright side of a global catastrophe, I was fortunate in the timing of my #DigPINS implementation project. While I could’t expose students to wet lab experiments, I could introduce them to digital laboratory notebooks that many top tier research universities and industry labs are using. So long are the days of  carbon copy paper, inked notes where a only single line through errors is permitted, and grainy pictures are taped directly to the pages. Thanks to the very supportive folks in ITS (Taylor Jadin and Susan Ashley) I was able to test a web based, open source lab notebook software:\nhttps://elabftw.knight.domains/\nTaylor and Susan definitely did the heavy lifting to get this thing online. This wasn’t a matter of clicking a button, but rather needed a web server and routing through knight.domains. Thanks to them, SNC now has its very own research grade digital lab notebook for classroom and research applications.\nAllow me to sell you on the wonders of this platform for scientific record keeping. If you are familiar with traditional lab notebooks, you know that there is only one record of the research experiment penned by students with only the most impeccable handwriting. You know that all of the information you need – units, dates, modifications to the protocol – are always there and formatted correctly. Lets not even go into how easy it is to sterilize a lab notebook and prevent cross contaminating your projects. Those of you who are not laboratory scientists reading this, please know every bit of that was sarcasm if it wasn’t already obvious. There are many drawbacks to traditional lab notebooks and many advantages to digital. For starters, the PI can create templates so that all experiments are recorded correctly and include all of the necessary information to repeat if  the protocol. Notes are typed, no longer will you have to guess if that student who has long since graduate meant to write 100 ul or 100 ml. Entries are stamped with the date, time, and user. Common protocols can be stored and copied in when needed. Sample databases, inventories, and SOPs can be stored in the digital lab notebook as well.  Users can include tables, photos, chemical formulas, and drawings. Progress is tracked with an easy to define color coding. Lastly, everything is backed up with tracking of previous versions.\nUse in the Classroom\nBack to this pandemic and how this digital lab notebook was a savior. Normally in this module of students would record observations and drawing in paper notebooks and I would be forced to lug around 48 of these things, each a slightly different size, some with notes from other classes, none in the format I requested to expedite grading. Using this digital lab notebook, I was able to assign users, assign them to different sections, and index each of the entries using tags for quick searches. Most importantly everything is accessible online so students can complete them from anywhere, I am able to grade them from anywhere, and I can save my tote bags for the farmers market. Since I couldn’t send them home with their very own pigs, I did have to rely on virtual dissection software for the remaining labs. However, students could still work on all of the pertinent skills in note taking and record keeping. Heads up, internal anatomy below:\nDigital\nCompetencies and Future Direction\nThis platform provides a lot of opportunities for students to build their digital literacy skills.\n–\nDigital Survival Skills\n: Networks and file management, Troubleshooting\n–\nDigital Communication\n: Collaborative communication, Digital writing and publishing\n–\nData Management and Preservation\n: Electronic data collection, Privacy, security and preservation, Cleaning, organizing, and managing data, Metadata\n–\nData Analysis and Presentation\n: Data analysis, Critical data visualization\n–\nCritical Making, Design and Development\n: Project management, Digital research and scholarship\nMoving forward, I will be spending time setting up the necessary framework for students to contribute work to the digital lab notebook both in the classroom and as part of my scholarship. I’ll need to expand on the tags, templates, and databases so that as students work their additions are consistent with past work. My experience so far has been nothing but positive.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nMy Journey with #digPINS…Round 2!\nNext Post\nUsing Flipgrid Videos and Breakout Rooms to help students discuss crime fiction\n(2) Comments\nReid Riggle\nMay 21, 2020 at 10:33 pm\nReply\nWow.

The idea of digital notebooks could extend far beyond the sciences. Whether working online or face-to-face, this type of record keeping may be preferred by students and instructors alike.

I especially appreciate how she analyzes the different ways instructors in the sciences are continuously engaging with active learning strategies from Open Pedagogy.\nI recognize several teaching strategies and common arguments resisting to such tools—as an instructor of modern languages, who teaches from beginning-level language classes to advanced-literature courses and capstone seminars in the French and Spanish programs at SNC.\nSometimes I explain to students (colleagues or friends) that learning a foreign language requires tools similar to the ones used in the sciences because we too have very factual information which is essential to: 1) learn the core syntax about any particular language; and 2) assist in the creation of straight-forward or more-complex sentences (and their corresponding level of meaning and sophistication).\nAnd although this is a very prescriptive learning approach, foreign language acquisition (inclusive of all those foundational grammatical structures and pronunciation competences) does not necessarily mean repetitive (and apparently “boring” to some) activities. On the contrary—and agreeing entirely with Karen—, these are excellent teaching opportunities to stimulate student interest and motivation to go beyond uneventful memorizations in language courses.\nAs an open pedagogy instructor myself, one of the goals in my language curriculum concurs with Karen’s argument when she calls us to “spark for the search that leads to foundations,” which allows students to not only make their own associations but to engage in the “significant learning” that goes beyond the classroom.\nThank you, Karen!

However, I’d have been a major hypocrite if I wasn’t able to put my own (mixed with Tyson’s) advice into practice and adapt to the pandemic, so that’s what we had to do this semester.\nAlthough I had lofty plans of having MBA students create a Facebook Fan Page where they had to get a certain number of fans by the end of the semester and incorporating all sorts of cool metrics and analyses, that had to be put on hold due to the coronavirus. That doesn’t mean that I was unable to incorporate new digital pedagogical techniques into my class, and I was even able to obtain a bit of data from it!\nMy students (both undergrad and MBA) are required to complete a simulation where they create a brand new 3d printed carbon fiber bicycle and compete against each other to see who forms the best company (as evaluated in on 5 criteria). Due to a desire to be as adaptable and equitable as possible, I decided to switch it up where every student plays individually against the computers. Although this change exponentially increased my work (I went from 13 teams to 73!), I found an opportunity to collect data to determine factors that influence objective performance on the game as well as subjective perceptions of learning. The goal is to be able to use those data to improve how I guide students through the simulation. Also, more for fun than anything, I actually played the simulation (individually, against the computer like the students), which put me in a much better position to guide them throughout all the decisions they had to make.\nI’ve only been able to briefly analyze the data, but the results are interesting so far! First, it seems that students find tremendous value in the simulation across the board. Interestingly, this doesn’t seem to be moderated by objective performance, so those who do better don’t necessarily like the simulation more. Second, it seems that the teams that spend the most time making the required decisions are the ones that end up performing the best. This will be particularly helpful, as it is further evidence that the decisions students make determine their objective performance. There are a few more analyzes I need to run (when I finally get some time), but I’m hopeful to get a lot more insights. I’ll update the blog as I analyze those data!\nOne of the most beneficial aspects of being familiar with innovative digital pedagogical techniques is that it gives you the necessary tools to be flexible and adapt to the situation after you get punched in the face. These tools allow us to pivot and move so we’ll be able to counterpunch the coronavirus (or whatever it is that punches us in the mouth!).\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nUsing Flipgrid Videos and Breakout Rooms to help students discuss crime fiction\nNext Post\nNecessity is the mother of invention\n(4) Comments\nReid\nMay 24, 2020 at 1:14 pm\nReply\nTechnological adaptability is a critical skill.  You modeled that attribute in your course adjustments.   The finding regarding the time investment is valuable.   As you continue your analysis it would be interesting to know how the shift in the design of the simulation impacted the performance of your students.\nI am very interested in learning more about how the design of your simulation and the impact on student learning.  In particular, what are the underlying design principles that could be generalized to other disciplines.\nMiles\nMay 28, 2020 at 2:17 pm\nMy plan is to continue to collect these data, since I do the simulation every semester with my intro students and my MBA students when I teach that class, so I’m really interested in seeing how the results will differ across semesters and situations. So far, it seems that students really love it, to the extent that there might be a ceiling effect with the subective perceptions of learning (i.e., they all thought they learned regardless of time spent, competition, objective performance, etc.), so I’m also interested to see what the additional analyses tell us about how to best implement these simulations moving forward.\nThomas Bolin (Tom)\nJune 3, 2020 at 3:52 pm\nReply\nThis is an amazing assignment.

What does our institution owe us?\nI especially liked Dr. Tressie McMillan Cottom’s piece this week:\nTo institutions: if you want the reputational currency of public scholars you’d better have institutional processes & courage to go with it— The Dr. Tressie McMillan Cottom (@tressiemcphd)\nMay 12, 2015\nI can’t believe this piece is 4 years old. I’d like to have a frank conversation as an institution about context collapse and how our (employees of the College) social media content is and isn’t part of the institutional memory, may or may not be scholarship, and what our authors’ rights are. I know folks who have been questioned by the institution for critiquing or calling out the practices, policies, or actions of the institution online. “In this moment we should call for institutions to state explicitly what they owe those who venture into public waters.”\nFrom this week’s McMillan Cottom’s piece, I linked out to her previous piece,\nhttps://tressiemc.com/uncategorized/forced-context-collapse-or-the-right-to-hide-in-plain-sight/\nin which she writes about media organizations borrowing tweets from randoms:\nContext collapse has mostly been about the control I can exert over how and when and where I perform the identity I think most appropriate for a situation. But what media organizations’ “tweet borrowing” does is strip me of that autonomy. They do this through a little idea called power. By virtue of being media and a company, these institutions are more powerful than little ol’ me. They have greater amplification power and more money to spend drowning out my resistance and more protection when they make a mistake than do individuals.\nAgain, what are our authors’ rights? Do we know how to respond to our digital scholarship being borrowed? How does digital scholarship coexist with everything else on the web? Are we taking the time to understand how much ownership we retain when we Tweet or vlog? We don’t have the rights of a public square on most of the popular social media platforms. And due to context collapse, are we ever not representing our institution? What does that mean for our digital scholarship? And how does our institution respond to that? And are we really savvy enough–as readers, analyzers, synthesizers–to recognize a scholarly tweet or blog post vs. a personal one in this age of context collapse?

Leila Walker’s article in particular, reminded me of many of the conversations that I have heard regarding the rapidly growing field of digital humanities. In fact, panels on the digital humanities abound at the annual MLA Conference (Modern Language Association), or at least they have since I first started attending in 2016. This January, I attended several panels on the topic, and as typically occurs following these panels, the audience agrees that the work is very interesting but wonders how it will be evaluated for tenure and promotion. It goes without saying that such concerns are valid, especially for junior faculty.\nAnother idea that Leila Walker discussed that I found interesting was that of public peer-review. While I would have to investigate the specific examples that she gave to know more about them, the idea reminded me of an instance where a well-established scholar that I know invited various people to comment on and review a draft of an article that he was working on. He used Academia.edu to do this and although I decided not to comment on his draft (our main areas are different), I remember thinking that it was refreshing to see someone held in high regard show his scholarship as a work-in-progress. This is something that I would be interested in trying in the future.\n“Just imagine if we could all see our academic heroes struggle through peer review — our own reader reports might be less intimidating.”\n— Leila Walker, “\nBeyond Academic Twitter: Social Media and the Evolution of Scholarly Publication\n.”\nAs I was reading the information for this week, I had a utopian moment, a brief chimera, in which I imagined what it might be like if the internet was flooded with peer-reviewed information and open access journals. My quixotic vision did not last long, and the following segment from Bonnie Stewart’s piece really hit home: “But we cling to the academic publishing system because it’s a prestige economy. […] apparently they will have to pry it from our cold, dead, mostly-precariously-employed hands because there seems to be far more attachment to the impact factor of prestigious journals than to the possibility of changing things.” I hope that we begin to see more acceptance of online and open access scholarship, and I would like to read Stewart’s publication that she references in the blog post on the topic. I also think that the majority of scholars today would agree with Stewart that there needs to be a change in order reach a wider audience. The tides seem to change slowly in academia, but I do believe they are changing to widen the at times narrow concept of what “counts” as scholarship.\nSource\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nThe Scholarship Dilemma\nNext Post\nThe End (for now)\n(2) Comments\nReid Riggle\nFebruary 3, 2019 at 4:45 pm\nReply\nWe can’t change the world if we don’t try.

As an individual on the tenure track, I spend a LOT of time thinking about my scholarship and how to disseminate it. One of my biggest issues with academia is that more often than not our reach can be limited. Our scholarship may not necessarily be read by those we truly want to be reading it, and instead is just read by other scholars. As a sociologist, I can expect other sociologists or sociology students to read my work. As a social worker, my goal is to have somewhat of a broader reach. But, it’s a bit difficult when you have to constantly be thinking about tenure and how your scholarship will be “read”. It’s sad that we put so much value on peer reviewed articles and don’t truly take into consideration the type of impact our scholarship can do elsewhere. For example, my scholarship focuses on race and socialization in families. Many of the families in my research want to read my work, but don’t necessarily have access to the journals it’d typically be published in. That, or the format of peer reviewed articles is so out of reach that even if they do have access, it’s so boring!!\nThese readings made me start to think differently about how I can disseminate my scholarship. I’ll definitely be looking into open access journals as well as other opportunities to translate my scholarship to those I really want to reach, perhaps in Op-Eds. But again, I wonder how this will be perceived for tenure and promotion…\nAt the end of day, my research is about and for families. If they can’t access it or translate it, then what’s the point??? I struggle with what I’m “supposed” to do for tenure and what is meaningful and fulfilling for me. It goes back this idea of who has access to knowledge… who “deserves” this access?\nI’d be super interested in hearing how others navigate this dilemma!!\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nMy Journey with #digPINS\nNext Post\nReflections on Digital Scholarship\n(1) Comment\nAvery\nFebruary 2, 2019 at 3:45 pm\nReply\nCristina, thank you for sharing your perspective as tenure track faculty.

However, given the current global situation, all my courses suddenly transitioned to online teaching. I immediately started exploring new methods to communicate and collaborate with students. I recorded lectures, scheduled video meetings, assigned online homework and exams, and modified the grade book on Moodle. I could not believe I was fully immersed in digital pedagogy! The grade book was particularly important as students were able to receive immediate feedback on their work. Exams, quizzes and online assignments were directly linked to the grade book and students had easy access to a grading rubric.\nFor this blog, I will focus on the original #DigPINS project which explored new methods of assessment. Throughout the semester, students were assigned an essay and a final research paper. The writing assignments went through a peer-review process that involved multiple steps. The end product was rewarding and productive, however, we encountered a few challenges on our path. The main challenge was in relation to logistics. Going over the peer-review process took an entire class period and would have been a disaster without Susan Ashley’s support. We arranged for Susan to join the class for the second part. For the first half-hour, I discussed the format and expectations for the writing assignments. Susan explained the logistics of the peer-review process and answered questions.\nAfter clarifying the expectations and logistics of the peer-review process, students submitted their work. Peers offered detailed feedback and suggested corrections. Moreover, the peer-review process encouraged students to analytically review an essay, critically reflect on the writing process and develop critical thinking skills. By offering the opportunity to do peer-review, students were actively engaged in the grading process. Also, students showed enthusiasm in sharing their thoughts about the grading rubric. I was glad to see students take an active role in crafting a rubric system which allowed for a more student-centered project. The peer-review task was an exciting opportunity to empower students to take an active role in their own learning. The project incorporated strategies presented in the Bryn Mawr model, especially digital communication and digital survival skills.

What does our institution owe us? – SNC #DigPINS","text":"Home\n>\nBlog\n>\nScholarship\n>\nWeek 4! What does our institution owe us?\nI especially liked Dr. Tressie McMillan Cottom’s piece this week:\nTo institutions: if you want the reputational currency of public scholars you’d better have institutional processes & courage to go with it— The Dr. Tressie McMillan Cottom (@tressiemcphd)\nMay 12, 2015\nI can’t believe this piece is 4 years old. I’d like to have a frank conversation as an institution about context collapse and how our (employees of the College) social media content is and isn’t part of the institutional memory, may or may not be scholarship, and what our authors’ rights are. I know folks who have been questioned by the institution for critiquing or calling out the practices, policies, or actions of the institution online. “In this moment we should call for institutions to state explicitly what they owe those who venture into public waters.”\nFrom this week’s McMillan Cottom’s piece, I linked out to her previous piece,\nhttps://tressiemc.com/uncategorized/forced-context-collapse-or-the-right-to-hide-in-plain-sight/\nin which she writes about media organizations borrowing tweets from randoms:\nContext collapse has mostly been about the control I can exert over how and when and where I perform the identity I think most appropriate for a situation. But what media organizations’ “tweet borrowing” does is strip me of that autonomy. They do this through a little idea called power. By virtue of being media and a company, these institutions are more powerful than little ol’ me. They have greater amplification power and more money to spend drowning out my resistance and more protection when they make a mistake than do individuals.\nAgain, what are our authors’ rights? Do we know how to respond to our digital scholarship being borrowed? How does digital scholarship coexist with everything else on the web? Are we taking the time to understand how much ownership we retain when we Tweet or vlog? We don’t have the rights of a public square on most of the popular social media platforms. And due to context collapse, are we ever not representing our institution? What does that mean for our digital scholarship? And how does our institution respond to that? And are we really savvy enough–as readers, analyzers, synthesizers–to recognize a scholarly tweet or blog post vs. a personal one in this age of context collapse? And if we’re not, then what?\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\n2\nbloggers\nlike this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nReflections of Week 3 (in the middle of Week 4)\nNext Post\n#DigPINS 2019\n(2) Comments\nReid Riggle\nJuly 16, 2019 at 4:58 pm\nReply\nBig, important, questions.

{"id":"ffa7dcbf-83e8-45eb-a8f8-69777ff22b32","url":"https://snc.digpins.org/transitioning-to-online-teaching/?replytocom=309","title":"Transitioning to Online Teaching – SNC #DigPINS","text":"Home\n>\nBlog\n>\nImplementation Report\n>\nTransitioning to Online Teaching\nCCO:\n@charlesdeluvio\nCCO:\n@charlesdeluvio\nTransitioning to Online Teaching\nThe original proposal for the #DigPINS project was to create an online assignment. However, given the current global situation, all my courses suddenly transitioned to online teaching. I immediately started exploring new methods to communicate and collaborate with students. I recorded lectures, scheduled video meetings, assigned online homework and exams, and modified the grade book on Moodle. I could not believe I was fully immersed in digital pedagogy! The grade book was particularly important as students were able to receive immediate feedback on their work. Exams, quizzes and online assignments were directly linked to the grade book and students had easy access to a grading rubric.\nFor this blog, I will focus on the original #DigPINS project which explored new methods of assessment. Throughout the semester, students were assigned an essay and a final research paper. The writing assignments went through a peer-review process that involved multiple steps. The end product was rewarding and productive, however, we encountered a few challenges on our path. The main challenge was in relation to logistics. Going over the peer-review process took an entire class period and would have been a disaster without Susan Ashley’s support. We arranged for Susan to join the class for the second part. For the first half-hour, I discussed the format and expectations for the writing assignments. Susan explained the logistics of the peer-review process and answered questions.\nAfter clarifying the expectations and logistics of the peer-review process, students submitted their work. Peers offered detailed feedback and suggested corrections. Moreover, the peer-review process encouraged students to analytically review an essay, critically reflect on the writing process and develop critical thinking skills. By offering the opportunity to do peer-review, students were actively engaged in the grading process. Also, students showed enthusiasm in sharing their thoughts about the grading rubric. I was glad to see students take an active role in crafting a rubric system which allowed for a more student-centered project. The peer-review task was an exciting opportunity to empower students to take an active role in their own learning. The project incorporated strategies presented in the Bryn Mawr model, especially digital communication and digital survival skills. Through digital platforms, students were able to actively communicate and collaborate on their projects and develop their reading, writing and language skills. Furthermore, students strengthen their digital survival skills as they learned to upload, download, edit and organize Google documents.\nIn this course, students showed an enthusiasm for the project and for the opportunity to collaborate with classmates in reviewing assignments. Comments regarding the peer-review assignments expressed an appreciation for detailed student feedback and recommendations for grammatical corrections. Through peer feedback, students were encouraged to analytical review their work and critically reflect on the writing process. Students reported peer review encouraged clarity, effective communication, and enhanced their work through an exchange of ideas.\nThe IT team was amazing!

Meh… #DigPINS and Digital Lab Notebooks – SNC #DigPINS","text":"Home\n>\nBlog\n>\nImplementation Report\n>\nPANDEMIC!?! Meh… #DigPINS and Digital Lab Notebooks\nIn these unprecedented times… this significant event in our history… this once in a lifetime pandemic… did I miss any other cliche openings to reference the mess that this semester turned into? I may be speaking to the choir (now meeting\nvirtually\nas singing spreads respiratory droplets), but participating in #DigPINS has made this transition to distance learning not nearly as jarring as others may have experienced. I was already prepared for delivering content online via Google Meets, students turn in PDF copies of their work in Moodle, and the text is an OER (\nOpenStax\n) available freely online. Teaching a lab based course though did present a challenge – how do you provide practical hands on experiences that students need for careers in the sciences? Spring break was coming and the rumblings were starting that we wouldn’t come back to campus right away, or at all. We were finishing our biodiversity module and still had some dissections left to complete that were originally scheduled for the weeks after break. I did consider sending them home with a fetal pig to dissect but the logistics just didn’t work out in time.\nSetting Up a Digital Lab Notebook\nIf I can look at the bright side of a global catastrophe, I was fortunate in the timing of my #DigPINS implementation project. While I could’t expose students to wet lab experiments, I could introduce them to digital laboratory notebooks that many top tier research universities and industry labs are using. So long are the days of  carbon copy paper, inked notes where a only single line through errors is permitted, and grainy pictures are taped directly to the pages. Thanks to the very supportive folks in ITS (Taylor Jadin and Susan Ashley) I was able to test a web based, open source lab notebook software:\nhttps://elabftw.knight.domains/\nTaylor and Susan definitely did the heavy lifting to get this thing online. This wasn’t a matter of clicking a button, but rather needed a web server and routing through knight.domains. Thanks to them, SNC now has its very own research grade digital lab notebook for classroom and research applications.\nAllow me to sell you on the wonders of this platform for scientific record keeping. If you are familiar with traditional lab notebooks, you know that there is only one record of the research experiment penned by students with only the most impeccable handwriting. You know that all of the information you need – units, dates, modifications to the protocol – are always there and formatted correctly. Lets not even go into how easy it is to sterilize a lab notebook and prevent cross contaminating your projects. Those of you who are not laboratory scientists reading this, please know every bit of that was sarcasm if it wasn’t already obvious. There are many drawbacks to traditional lab notebooks and many advantages to digital. For starters, the PI can create templates so that all experiments are recorded correctly and include all of the necessary information to repeat if  the protocol. Notes are typed, no longer will you have to guess if that student who has long since graduate meant to write 100 ul or 100 ml. Entries are stamped with the date, time, and user. Common protocols can be stored and copied in when needed. Sample databases, inventories, and SOPs can be stored in the digital lab notebook as well.  Users can include tables, photos, chemical formulas, and drawings. Progress is tracked with an easy to define color coding. Lastly, everything is backed up with tracking of previous versions.\nUse in the Classroom\nBack to this pandemic and how this digital lab notebook was a savior. Normally in this module of students would record observations and drawing in paper notebooks and I would be forced to lug around 48 of these things, each a slightly different size, some with notes from other classes, none in the format I requested to expedite grading. Using this digital lab notebook, I was able to assign users, assign them to different sections, and index each of the entries using tags for quick searches. Most importantly everything is accessible online so students can complete them from anywhere, I am able to grade them from anywhere, and I can save my tote bags for the farmers market. Since I couldn’t send them home with their very own pigs, I did have to rely on virtual dissection software for the remaining labs. However, students could still work on all of the pertinent skills in note taking and record keeping. Heads up, internal anatomy below:\nDigital\nCompetencies and Future Direction\nThis platform provides a lot of opportunities for students to build their digital literacy skills.\n–\nDigital Survival Skills\n: Networks and file management, Troubleshooting\n–\nDigital Communication\n: Collaborative communication, Digital writing and publishing\n–\nData Management and Preservation\n: Electronic data collection, Privacy, security and preservation, Cleaning, organizing, and managing data, Metadata\n–\nData Analysis and Presentation\n: Data analysis, Critical data visualization\n–\nCritical Making, Design and Development\n: Project management, Digital research and scholarship\nMoving forward, I will be spending time setting up the necessary framework for students to contribute work to the digital lab notebook both in the classroom and as part of my scholarship. I’ll need to expand on the tags, templates, and databases so that as students work their additions are consistent with past work. My experience so far has been nothing but positive.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nMy Journey with #digPINS…Round 2!\nNext Post\nUsing Flipgrid Videos and Breakout Rooms to help students discuss crime fiction\n(2) Comments\nReid Riggle\nMay 21, 2020 at 10:33 pm\nReply\nWow.  I want to take that class!  Thanks for sharing your project.   This is a great example of how a digital strategy can support learning.  It sounds like it was a good tool from the instructor perspective.   What did your students think about the notebooks?\nSusan\nMay 24, 2020 at 8:07 pm\nReply\nAdam, first of all, I am thrilled to hear your voice in this post. One skill in writing a blog is to allow your reader to hear the real you, and you have done this nicely.\nIt has been great working with you on this initiative. The idea of digital notebooks could extend far beyond the sciences. Whether working online or face-to-face, this type of record keeping may be preferred by students and instructors alike. The digital skills embarked by this type of assignment will enable students to take what they are learning here at SNC into the next phase of their life and to lifelong learning. I am looking forward to hearing what students think.\nLeave a Reply to\nReid Riggle\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\nWrite a Comment...\nEmail (Required)\nName (Required)\nWebsite\nLoading Comments...\nComment\n×\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

However, I’d have been a major hypocrite if I wasn’t able to put my own (mixed with Tyson’s) advice into practice and adapt to the pandemic, so that’s what we had to do this semester.\nAlthough I had lofty plans of having MBA students create a Facebook Fan Page where they had to get a certain number of fans by the end of the semester and incorporating all sorts of cool metrics and analyses, that had to be put on hold due to the coronavirus. That doesn’t mean that I was unable to incorporate new digital pedagogical techniques into my class, and I was even able to obtain a bit of data from it!\nMy students (both undergrad and MBA) are required to complete a simulation where they create a brand new 3d printed carbon fiber bicycle and compete against each other to see who forms the best company (as evaluated in on 5 criteria). Due to a desire to be as adaptable and equitable as possible, I decided to switch it up where every student plays individually against the computers. Although this change exponentially increased my work (I went from 13 teams to 73!), I found an opportunity to collect data to determine factors that influence objective performance on the game as well as subjective perceptions of learning. The goal is to be able to use those data to improve how I guide students through the simulation. Also, more for fun than anything, I actually played the simulation (individually, against the computer like the students), which put me in a much better position to guide them throughout all the decisions they had to make.\nI’ve only been able to briefly analyze the data, but the results are interesting so far! First, it seems that students find tremendous value in the simulation across the board. Interestingly, this doesn’t seem to be moderated by objective performance, so those who do better don’t necessarily like the simulation more. Second, it seems that the teams that spend the most time making the required decisions are the ones that end up performing the best. This will be particularly helpful, as it is further evidence that the decisions students make determine their objective performance. There are a few more analyzes I need to run (when I finally get some time), but I’m hopeful to get a lot more insights. I’ll update the blog as I analyze those data!\nOne of the most beneficial aspects of being familiar with innovative digital pedagogical techniques is that it gives you the necessary tools to be flexible and adapt to the situation after you get punched in the face. These tools allow us to pivot and move so we’ll be able to counterpunch the coronavirus (or whatever it is that punches us in the mouth!).\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nUsing Flipgrid Videos and Breakout Rooms to help students discuss crime fiction\nNext Post\nNecessity is the mother of invention\n(4) Comments\nReid\nMay 24, 2020 at 1:14 pm\nReply\nTechnological adaptability is a critical skill.  You modeled that attribute in your course adjustments.   The finding regarding the time investment is valuable.   As you continue your analysis it would be interesting to know how the shift in the design of the simulation impacted the performance of your students.\nI am very interested in learning more about how the design of your simulation and the impact on student learning.  In particular, what are the underlying design principles that could be generalized to other disciplines.\nMiles\nMay 28, 2020 at 2:17 pm\nMy plan is to continue to collect these data, since I do the simulation every semester with my intro students and my MBA students when I teach that class, so I’m really interested in seeing how the results will differ across semesters and situations. So far, it seems that students really love it, to the extent that there might be a ceiling effect with the subective perceptions of learning (i.e., they all thought they learned regardless of time spent, competition, objective performance, etc.), so I’m also interested to see what the additional analyses tell us about how to best implement these simulations moving forward.\nThomas Bolin (Tom)\nJune 3, 2020 at 3:52 pm\nReply\nThis is an amazing assignment.

Can’t say I will blog again anytime soon but this sure has been an interesting journey. I find myself surprised to be wanting MORE!\nThis week’s material on dissemination of scholarship and access was fascinating. I was particularly intrigued by:\nOpen Access Explained!\nby PhD Comics. It broke things down to a basic-anyone-not-in-academia-can-understand level which as a non-faculty member (with a short attention span but fierce hunger to learn) I deeply appreciated. It is astounding that what is keeping these for-profit publishing systems alive is the perception of prestige. It seems like such a simple fix looking at it from the outside but monsters of our own making are often the hardest to defeat.\nOther than these bangin’ blog posts of mine, I have never published through any medium/on any forum but if it is something I ever aspire to do I will do it through an open access publisher. Higher education has under scrutiny over recent years and there is a constant pressure to prove our value. It’ll be much harder to prove our worth if we continue to bury valuable knowledge in journal subscriptions, fees, and other barriers. I admire the bold folks who have started the push towards open access.\nThank you again, for allowing me to participate in #DigPINS.

I made some progress, but I imagine if I were to continue teaching I likely would still focus on more traditional formats. I liked this work, and I think the students liked it, too, but I probably did not embrace it as fully as I could have, and in the future, am not 100% sure how I would approach it.\nIn the past I had a “blog” requirement, and a hope and expectation that the writing students would do for a blog assignment would be substantively different from more traditional writing they had done for me in other classes, and  I supplemented those assignments with “Top 10” lists of hints from a variety of sources. To some degree that worked, but it always felt like an “add-on,” of sorts. With this DigPins opportunity I hoped to remedy that notion, and to improve the course.\nTo start off on the right foot I actually engaged the services and professionalism of Susan and Taylor to help me think through a blogging opportunity as I developed my course, in ways I simply had not done before. So even though I had taught the course before and had utilized a blogging assignment, I had never consulted with anyone in ITS. That was incredibly helpful, partly from a technical standpoint, but more importantly from a pedagogical perspective.\nAlong those lines, i hoped to build student’s digital competencies in the area of writing in an online medium. From\nBryn Mawr Digital Competencies Framework\n, I focused on the following competencies:\nLearning to critically analyze and effectively communicate using digital-age textual formats, such as hyperlinking and non-linear narrative.\nBecoming familiar with and comfortable using a range of digital publishing or social media tools, such as blogs, wikis, WordPress, Twitter, etc.\nLearning how to identify the digital publishing or social media tool that is most appropriate to given audiences, topics, and content.\nLearning how to give credit to other’s creative work and original ideas, through attribution conventions appropriate for digital media\nTo help students do this, I asked Susan and Taylor to visit with the class in order to explain how the technology worked, and most importantly, how to approach writing in this relatively new medium. The idea of writing online was not new to them, of course, but the idea of writing to an online audience, with a concrete prompt and expectation, was new for most of them.\nIn addition, I received guidance about simplifying and clarifying a rubric I have used in the past. This helped me with grading, to be sure, but again, most critically helped the students better understand how to approach this work.\nMy goals for this work were primarily rooted in developing sound fundamental writing skills for this particular medium, and for the most part — based on grades students earned — I believe this happened. More quixotically, perhaps, one of the criteria I used in my grading related to students finding and expressing their “voice,” and that remained an ongoing challenge throughout our work together. My direction, again and again, was that I hoped to be able to pick up any piece of writing, submitted anonymously, and know for certain who had written it, based primarily on the tone, style, and content of the piece. That got closer and closer to happening, but very few of the students really embraced the opportunity to let themselves shine through, in ways that would perhaps be less appropriate in a more formal writing assignment. Were I do to this again, I would continue working hard to try to help make that happen.\nI asked students to submit blogs for six consecutive weeks, in part hoping to keep them continually improving, and to some degree that happened. As a late addition to the class, in the wake of changes to class due to the coronavirus pandemic, I have asked for one final blog.

In the past, students have waited too long to study for the anatomy exams (the first one is week 6 of the semester) and then are unsuccessful. To motivate students to prepare sooner and to help them self-assess, I planned to use Socrative, IEAs for lecture material, and dissection activities for lab material. Socrative is a tool that makes it possible to ask MC questions during lecture to assess student comprehension. IEAs were designed to promote collaboration between students as they puzzled out the response to higher level, problem solving questions. Dissection activities guided students during lab and encouraged them to work as a team.\nIn addition to the IEA component, I also added a digital tool called Virtual Microscope. Each Friday, we study slides to learn histology. We will use the microscopes in lab and also a digital tool: VM. The digital tool is a learning tool. Students can use this to review slides without being in lab. They can also create their own quizzes to prepare for lab exams. This is another tool that will motivate students to self-assess prior to the formative assessment.\nNote\n: As a result of COVID-19, I modified my original project. I dropped Socrative, but maintained the IEAs for lecture and lab material, and we are still using Virtual Microscope for histology. I added a virtual lab dissection experience whereby I show students structures that I have dissected and then quiz them on those. I also added an online resource, virtual dissection software, for the students. And, I added chalk talks, recorded lecture discussions for students to view prior to virtual class meetings.\nProject Results\nElevating student learning\nThe IEA assignments were successful on two major fronts: student engagement and community building. Students were probing the material and asking deep, thoughtful questions. I noticed that they (at least some of the students) were migrating away from surface learning or memorizing material. I noticed that students were asking higher level questions about the material for which they had completed an IEA. Students, themselves, commented on how the dissection activities prepared them to better understand lab material. For example, students were directed to draw a diagram of the branches of the celiac artery (there are three main branches and then several more from those vessels). Students reported that creating the diagram made it easier to understand the branching pattern we studied on the donor in our virtual lab experience. Likewise with the kidney assignment.\nAn unexpected, but added bonus, is that encouraging students to work together in pairs and lab teams created a solid learning community. These relationships between the students have benefitted them in the transition to remote learning.\nDigital Literacy Tools\nUse of Socrative and VM helped students to build skills in metacognition and life-long learning and collaborative communication. The metacognition piece is key to developing an ability to assess one’s knowledge and skills. This has been a valuable skills with the move to remote learning.\nAs students answer questions or compete with digital games during class, they are using a digital tool to make learning fun and more memorable while assessing their knowledge. Students have responded positively by asking more in depth questions in the future in preparation for exams.\nLearning to use VM for studying and beyond (they can explore pathology in addition to normal tissue study) helped students develop skills using digital resources in new ways that promote learning. Having developed a comfort level with online resources facilitated use of the new virtual dissection tool for some students. Likewise, using Socrative and VM, students became familiar with these digital tools and learned how to use them for studying. Students worked in teams for VM, thus, they developed collaborative communication skills as they learned to use the technology together.\nResources for success\nTo facilitate student success with the digital tools, I provided written instructions and also “walked” students through use of each tool upon introduction. For example, Socrative was introduced the second day of class using simple questions about the syllabus and student goals for the course. We tried a couple of variations of questioning format as well (e.g. competitive by individual vs. teams). The Virtual Microscope application, Biolucida, is a tool students learned to use the second time we met for histology. I created written directions and posted them to Moodle and then we used the program together during class time. Likewise, when I introduced the virtual dissection software, I walked students through a specific example, as we met virtually. This was supplemented with written instructions and a practice activity for skill building that related directly to content we were learning in lab.\nAssessment plan\nMy original assessment plan included a combination of tools. To measure student engagement, I planned on using Peer Review, student self-assessment, and a dissection rubric. Once we entered remote teaching mode, I modified my assessment plan. To assess student engagement, I am meeting with my two teaching assistants 2-3 times per week. Generally, the sense is that the IEAs are well received and definitely helping students learn the material. I offered to not have any more IEAs for the last two weeks, but students requested that we keep this piece of the course. Other methods I am using to measure student engagement include the virtual lab presentations and quizzing sessions. I assign each student a number and quiz them during virtual lab. Most of the students are quick to identify structures and thus, seem to be engaged in learning the material despite not being able to be physically present in lab. I was pleasantly surprised to note that students performed as well on exam II and lab practical II (online version) as they did on the first exam and lab practical (non-remote).\nImplementation period\nThe addition of intellectual engagement activities for lecture and lab and digital tools for dissection and the study of histology, occurred in the Spring semester of 2020. The project started in January, the first week of class and will end at the end of the semester.\nConclusion and Next steps\nAddition of the intellectual engagement activities for lecture and lab were very successful in elevating student learning. These pieces encouraged students to go past surface learning and explore the material more deeply. Key to this, it gave students some structure and/or ideas about how to learn more deeply. And, to build this skill out for future use, we talked about general strategies that would enhance the usefulness of this technique for any subject matter.\nI plan to continue using IEAs with a specific focus on how they can be combined with digital tools such as the virtual cadaver dissection and virtual microscope tool. Teaching students how to assess their own learning and how to probe a topic more deeply to enhance understanding is a very useful skill, for any course. Many of my students have been successful with the transition to remote learning because we were already practicing self-learning and metacognition skills and had developed a strong learning community.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nBlogs as a space for critical and collective reflection.\nNext Post\nBack to the Future … er, … Past\n(1) Comment\nSusan Ashley\nApril 21, 2020 at 3:17 pm\nReply\nDeb,\nWhen I read this blog, I think of a few phrases. Phrases like student engagement, student learning, course objectives, technology tool review, student feedback, and teaching flexibility come to mind.  It is evident that these things are important components of your teaching. This student centered approach elevates learning in your classroom, whether face to face or online. Your content delivery methods are pedagogically aligned. It is exciting to hear the results of the assessment scores during the second half of the semester. Learning the tech tools is time consuming, I know, but the benefits have certainly been obvious.\nStudent interaction and community are so very important, if you were to have taught this solely online, without the benefit of  the face to face relationship building that you had earlier this semester, what other activities would you incorporate in the remote setting to build community?\nLeave a Reply to\nSusan Ashley\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}
{"id":"f4dc67c1-4a86-47d4-ad3c-730a095bf2ef","url":"https://snc.digpins.org/digpins-project/?replytocom=157","title":"#DigPINS Project – SNC #DigPINS","text":"Home\n>\nBlog\n>\nIdentity\n>\n#DigPINS Project\nCCO: Photo by rawpixel.com from Pexels\nThe opportunity to participate in the spring 2019 #DigPINS cohort experience changed the way I think about digital media, engage with technology in my everyday life, teach and do research. Throughout our weekly blogs, conversations, and frequent visits to IT, I was able to learn more about topics, such as digital pedagogy, research, citizenship, identity, and networking.\nReading articles about digital citizenship reminded me of the important responsibility I have as an instructor, researcher and friend to critically examine, not only the information I share on social media, but also how I share it. After reading an article on Creative Commons and meeting with Taylor and Autumm, I realized that my pedagogy relies heavily on videos, photos, audio, and other digital sources available online. However, I was unsure if the sources I integrated into my teaching were part of a Creative Commons domain. This led me to revisit much of my work and, in the process, I realized I didn’t use any Creative Commons material. I immediately started redoing all the audiovisual information I had publicly shared with students.\nThis was not an easy task, but it was highly rewarding, as I began to explore multiple Creative Commons platforms legally available to share creative and innovative work produced by individuals and communities all over the world. For weeks, I visited endless websites and came across hundreds of magnificent photos and videos that vividly showed Latin American culture and history. The discovery of a Creative Commons domain and the endless possibilities available there, led me to an idea, to ask my students in a Spanish Conversation, Composition and Culture course to explore Creative Commons domains for their final research paper and oral presentation. They were required to critically examine audiovisual productions and class readings for their projects. I was impressed, not only by their ability to comfortably navigate different Creative Commons domains, but also with the detailed research they presented. The photographs and videos, which the students analyzed for their final oral presentations brought diverse peoples, cultures and cities into the classroom. The angles, colors, lights, sounds, and many perspectives reflected in the photographs and videos, allowed for the class to better understand the given culture. The integration of public domain sources facilitated cultural awareness and empathy with other civilizations. Their presentations were connected to in-class readings, yet the students had complete autonomy to select outside audiovisual sources to support their research.\nFurthermore, after my first blog experience through #DigPINS, I decided to create a classroom blog, where students shared their opinions on class readings and films. The blog significantly helped students to select and develop a research project that linked in-class readings to outside sources. Every other week, students wrote a formal reaction to the readings and also commented on someone else’s blog. In their posts, students shared important observations and posed relevant questions. I was quite surprised by the in-depth analysis the students demonstrated in the works assigned and also by the sense of community that was thereby created. This safe digital space encouraged student engagement in a way I had not seen inside the classroom. Students were honest about expressing their thoughts and demonstrated a level of comfort to say whatever was on their minds. Their candid responses encouraged an interesting in-class dialog that allowed me to call on students to elaborate on their answers. The blog helped everyone in the classroom to actively participate. In fact, this was the first class to receive an A average for their participation grade. This was truly a unique class, and I was fortunate to share my digital media pedagogical knowledge with them. I am thrilled to think of what will come next in other classes.\nAnother component, which I explored this past semester, was Moodle. For the first time, I used Moodle to post all letter grades and share class material in designated folders. I found this method extremely helpful, as all expectations, resources, and grades were readily made available to the students. Films were also uploaded on Moodle, and the students could access them through their phones, tablets or computers.\nMoreover, the #DigPINS experience also helped me to rethink how I conduct my research and integrate it into my teaching. In the future, I look forward to using social media platforms to further advance my research agenda and connect them to special topics courses. I look forward to working on sites such as Academia and Twitter, in order to connect with academics in my field.\nI am uncertain as to what the next project will be, but I am excited to explore the possibilities of what I can do in the classroom with an iPad. I will definitely be visiting my IT friends for help and ideas. I want to thank everybody for a life-changing experience!\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nReflecting on Teaching Illustration Online\nNext Post\nANXIOUS BLOGGER\n(2) Comments\nReid Riggle\nJune 20, 2019 at 7:12 pm\nReply\nI appreciate the level of thoughtful reflection you express here, Judy.

My particular project focused on my Ethnic Geography course and me utilizing my own Domain (website) more during the course. This was important to me because I felt like I needed to practice what I was preaching. In the course I ask students to create their own\n#knightdomain\nto host their own learning artifacts from my course. This is new to many of our students, and so they need focus on both content and\nBryn Mawr learning objectives\n. In the past, class information was put onto Moodle (or Google Classroom), and I felt that making this course design change gave me both more credibility with my students and also made me understand some of their potential challenges with developing and building a Domain.\nBryn Mawr Digital Competencies\nUltimately, the project tied nicely into each of the skills in the Bryn Mawr framework. First, the project tied to\nDigital Survival Skills\nas it involved at time uploading files. @TaylorJadin and Susan Ashley often helped me better understand items such as embedding PDF files, Google Docs, and Word Docs. This tooks some maneuvering as well with learning some basic code as the Google Doc’s often appeared very small on my domain and I wanted them to have more “full screen” features. Troubleshooting with SNC’s TechBar team was essential in this project and process for me and it also proved that life-long learning is really essential in everything educational – including digital skills. This first skill also helped me in developing and starting to manage my own digital identity which was complex as I wanted to both showcase my skills to other scholars and employers online as well as be effective platforms of sharing information with my students at SNC. It was great to have the experience of building this with experts who could really assist me with the process. Without them, I would not have been successful.\nMy domain also hosts a few blogs, which is something that I also ask students to do in my own courses and ties to\nDigital Communication\n. Writing blogs and hosting them on my domain was just another example of modeling for students and me also gaining perspective on the process. At times there was trouble shooting in this process as well trying to embed my Twitter feed with limited success on my own. The #TechBarStudents were very helpful to me in this process, and I know that quite a few of my students needed help with embedding Twitter on their Domains.\nDigital Management and Preservation\nwasn’t a main focus but certainly present in my Domain. As we speak, I’m trying to copy my Domain to my own platform for life (unfortunately) after SNC. There were also times that I worked with @TaylorJadin to back up my website before making modifications.\nData Analysis and Presentation\nalso wasn’t a main focus…but we did add JetPack to each of my subdomains to have an idea of how often and which pages were the most utilized on my domain.\nCritical Making, Design and Development\nwas more of an essential component in my project. There were times that I talked with @ReidRiggle about the overall organization and appearance on the website, along with @TaylorJadin. This was a process and something that continuously evolved, including a few theme changes.\nOverall this project was very collaborative with various members of the SNC campus and I’m very grateful for the opportunity to improve my own skills and also to better understand the hiccups and areas where my students need help in creating their own domains.\nElevating Student Learning\nHaving my own Domain enabled me to have an example for students and show modeling. When I asked them to organize their own Domain’s they were able to see my own organizational features such as my drop down menus. They also saw how my information was not just on my home page but that I had different sections devoted to different aspects of my course. While Moodle and Google Classroom are learning platforms, I also felt that having my own Domain elevated student learning by having more of a “student friendly” platform. I believe the Domain was more visually pleasing and allowed me as a professor more freedom to organize the course – which ultimately elevated student learning as course information was easier to follow from a student perspective. Throughout the course, my students have to tie their artifacts to digital learning objectives from the Bryn Mawr Framework, and it was a great experience for me to practice digital learning along with them.\nWays to improve and what’s next?\nThis semester was crazy, to say the least. In a “normal” semester, I would have loved to create my own podcast. Many of my students use this digital artifact on their Domain and it’s an area where I always seem to be giving tips…so it would have been great to dip my toe in the water and do a podcast. In the future and with more time, this is an area where I would like to grow and where I would like to ultimately use my podcast as an example for students.\nWith the shift in the semester, I also found myself really having to change some of my delivery methods (which also fits in nicely with the Bryn Mawr Framework) and therefore I did not have time to gather a lot of feedback from students in terms of the organization of my website and what could be improved.\nMy plan is to continue using my domain this next school year wherever I “land” and continue utilizing the skills and tools that I’ve learned throughout this process. Thanks again SNC for this experience!\nBibliography for images:\ndigPINS image from\nhttps://autummcaines.com/digpins/\nBryn Mawr Framework from\nhttps://techbar.knight.domains/bryn-mawr-framework/\nThinking emoji\nhttps://imgflip.com/memetemplate/81561879/Thinking-emoji\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nUsing Google Tools to Promote Academic Integrity and Knowledge of Social Science\nNext Post\nPANDEMIC!?!

The digital skills acquired will reach way beyond the classroom or SNC.

How do we continue to curate our presence? As\nPasquini\nstates, “We can no longer use the expression ‘in real life’ or IRL, as your online self\nis\nyour real, off-line self. In addition, how we behave inside the screen, on the web and in our networks has real-life implications for our selves outside a device, platform or digital space.”\nThis is very interesting to me because I can remember a time when there  was a clear distinction between our online selves and our IRL selves,  especially in the early days of Facebook and Twitter. I still find  myself wanting to take to the Internet with thoughts or opinions I  wouldn’t necessarily express IRL. As  a result, I am very interested in thinking about– as\nStewart\nasks, “who are you talking to?” when you sit down in front of a screen or swipe  up on your phone. And as we think about the spaces we hope to curate or  contribute to, I’m becoming increasingly interested (given our current  moment of #MeToo) to apply critical whiteness theory to my understanding  of digital identity. Critical whiteness theory is meant to reveal the  invisible structures that produce and reproduce white supremacy and  privilege. Even though women and people of color use the Internet to  share their stories, the Internet is still a place where people can be silenced. The Internet is not a guaranteed safe space for women and  people of color, just like IRL spaces can become unsafe. How do women  and people of color curate safe spaces or respond to unsafe spaces? Is  the only option to leave said spaces, as many are doing?\nFurthermore,  I was thinking during the visitor/resident discussion how our digital  identity is being tracked and we’re always leaving a trace, even if  we’re not engaging. What are those implications for our digital identity?  How does that affect the way we cultivate our presence online and  engage with others? The communities we enter? What is the role of  consent in our online spaces? In terms of IRL harassment and violence,  it’s not the dark alleys that are the most dangerous, it’s often the  places and people you know and trust, it’s the places you frequent, that  can become unsafe(est). These are a few of the things I’m interested in exploring during #DigPINS.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nANXIOUS BLOGGER\nNext Post\nExploring My Digital Identity\n(2) Comments\nTaylor Jadin\nJune 27, 2019 at 12:34 am\nReply\n“How do women and people of color curate safe spaces or respond to unsafe spaces?

In the past, class information was put onto Moodle (or Google Classroom), and I felt that making this course design change gave me both more credibility with my students and also made me understand some of their potential challenges with developing and building a Domain.\nBryn Mawr Digital Competencies\nUltimately, the project tied nicely into each of the skills in the Bryn Mawr framework. First, the project tied to\nDigital Survival Skills\nas it involved at time uploading files. @TaylorJadin and Susan Ashley often helped me better understand items such as embedding PDF files, Google Docs, and Word Docs. This tooks some maneuvering as well with learning some basic code as the Google Doc’s often appeared very small on my domain and I wanted them to have more “full screen” features. Troubleshooting with SNC’s TechBar team was essential in this project and process for me and it also proved that life-long learning is really essential in everything educational – including digital skills. This first skill also helped me in developing and starting to manage my own digital identity which was complex as I wanted to both showcase my skills to other scholars and employers online as well as be effective platforms of sharing information with my students at SNC. It was great to have the experience of building this with experts who could really assist me with the process. Without them, I would not have been successful.\nMy domain also hosts a few blogs, which is something that I also ask students to do in my own courses and ties to\nDigital Communication\n. Writing blogs and hosting them on my domain was just another example of modeling for students and me also gaining perspective on the process. At times there was trouble shooting in this process as well trying to embed my Twitter feed with limited success on my own. The #TechBarStudents were very helpful to me in this process, and I know that quite a few of my students needed help with embedding Twitter on their Domains.\nDigital Management and Preservation\nwasn’t a main focus but certainly present in my Domain. As we speak, I’m trying to copy my Domain to my own platform for life (unfortunately) after SNC. There were also times that I worked with @TaylorJadin to back up my website before making modifications.\nData Analysis and Presentation\nalso wasn’t a main focus…but we did add JetPack to each of my subdomains to have an idea of how often and which pages were the most utilized on my domain.\nCritical Making, Design and Development\nwas more of an essential component in my project. There were times that I talked with @ReidRiggle about the overall organization and appearance on the website, along with @TaylorJadin. This was a process and something that continuously evolved, including a few theme changes.\nOverall this project was very collaborative with various members of the SNC campus and I’m very grateful for the opportunity to improve my own skills and also to better understand the hiccups and areas where my students need help in creating their own domains.\nElevating Student Learning\nHaving my own Domain enabled me to have an example for students and show modeling. When I asked them to organize their own Domain’s they were able to see my own organizational features such as my drop down menus. They also saw how my information was not just on my home page but that I had different sections devoted to different aspects of my course. While Moodle and Google Classroom are learning platforms, I also felt that having my own Domain elevated student learning by having more of a “student friendly” platform. I believe the Domain was more visually pleasing and allowed me as a professor more freedom to organize the course – which ultimately elevated student learning as course information was easier to follow from a student perspective. Throughout the course, my students have to tie their artifacts to digital learning objectives from the Bryn Mawr Framework, and it was a great experience for me to practice digital learning along with them.\nWays to improve and what’s next?\nThis semester was crazy, to say the least. In a “normal” semester, I would have loved to create my own podcast. Many of my students use this digital artifact on their Domain and it’s an area where I always seem to be giving tips…so it would have been great to dip my toe in the water and do a podcast. In the future and with more time, this is an area where I would like to grow and where I would like to ultimately use my podcast as an example for students.\nWith the shift in the semester, I also found myself really having to change some of my delivery methods (which also fits in nicely with the Bryn Mawr Framework) and therefore I did not have time to gather a lot of feedback from students in terms of the organization of my website and what could be improved.\nMy plan is to continue using my domain this next school year wherever I “land” and continue utilizing the skills and tools that I’ve learned throughout this process. Thanks again SNC for this experience!\nBibliography for images:\ndigPINS image from\nhttps://autummcaines.com/digpins/\nBryn Mawr Framework from\nhttps://techbar.knight.domains/bryn-mawr-framework/\nThinking emoji\nhttps://imgflip.com/memetemplate/81561879/Thinking-emoji\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nUsing Google Tools to Promote Academic Integrity and Knowledge of Social Science\nNext Post\nPANDEMIC!?!

Kudos for investing the time in doing this. I agree, I’m sure it provided a more “human” platform for your course. I’ve also thoroughly enjoyed the tweets from you and your students throughout the semester.\nSusan Ashley\nMay 13, 2020 at 5:13 pm\nReply\nI really enjoyed learning how this initiative elevated learning both for your students and for you. The digital skills acquired will reach way beyond the classroom or SNC. As you know, Covid-19 forced many to take their face to face courses and quickly transform them using an alternate form of delivery. Although this is not ideal, it seems you made the best of this situation for your courses.\nLeave a Reply to\nSusan Ashley\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\nWrite a Comment...\nEmail (Required)\nName (Required)\nWebsite\nLoading Comments...\nComment\n×\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

Marketing is becoming increasingly digital, and marketing programs need to update their curriculum in order to give students the skills necessary to respond to the changing industry (Rohm, Stefl, and Saint Clair 2019). The purpose of marketing education is to provide students with the skills and tools necessary to succeed as marketers, so it is essential that marketing programs adapt to the rapidly digitized marketing industry (Brennan 2012). An important component of offering students a valuable learning experience is to provide them opportunities to build their digital competencies to help them thrive in the digital world post-graduation. Students are increasingly required to manage and preserve data, to communicate digitally, to analyze and present data, to manage digital identities, and to make critical design and development decisions in a digital space (“Bryn Mawr Digital Competencies Framework” 2016). In order to keep marketing programs relevant, students must be given the opportunity to build these competencies while still in school.\nI used my Consumer Behavior marketing class to provide students with three opportunities to build digital competencies. First, students completed two digital marketing certifications (HubSpot social media certification and Google Analytics beginner certification) that are highly regarded in the industry and often required for digital marketing positions. Research also shows that these certifications help with job placement and success in the position (Staton 2016). Not only did this assignment force students to build their resume and be more attractive candidates on the job market, but it also allowed me to flip the classroom for that unit and give them a project to apply the knowledge they learned from the certifications. Specifically, I gave students real social media and website data from a local nonprofit that they were able to analyze and come up with recommendations for. I was fortunate enough to have access to these data and permission to share them, but it could have easily been done with fabricated data too.\nSecond, students applied the material we learned in class to develop a website for a brand of their own creation. Students were given the option to develop a website for a personal brand to promote themselves on the job market, for a brand for a company they want to actually create in the future, or for a fictitious brand (e.g., a fake clothing store). The college offers the Knight Domains service to students, which gives them server space and resources so they can develop their own websites or applications. The Tech Bar offers consultation and training in WordPress and its applications for students so over the course of the semester, students updated their websites and created their brand. Students also wrote five blog posts over the course of the semester and posted them to their sites. The first blog post was an intention post, where they created three personal learning objectives for assignment as well as tactics for accomplishing those objectives. Students then wrote three biweekly blog posts where they were required to relate the course content to their experience with creating the website. Finally, they were required to write a reflection blog post, where they had to reflect on whether they accomplished their learning objectives described in the intention post. After the semester, I got qualitative and quantitative data that suggested that students felt that they gained digital competencies and they felt more confident in their ability to be digital marketers after they graduate. I’ve submitted a proposal to present this at the Marketing Educators’ Association conference, so I’m hopeful I’ll be able to disseminate this and get more feedback on it in the spring.\nFinally, students completed the Buzzfeed Challenge (Cowley 2017), where they were required to identify a target market, create a BuzzFeed article or quiz that appeals to that market, and reach that market using online promotion principles and targeted influencer outreach. Their grade was, in part, determined by how many views they got (they needed at least 1000 views for full credit) and so their success was solely determined by the quality of the decisions they made. The number of views varied wildly, with a range of a couple hundred to more than 90,000! Students responded very positively to this assignment as well, and several students specifically said they learned more about marketing by doing the assignment.\nI was really happy with how these projects turned out. It really seemed like the students were really engaged with the assignments, and understood their importance in terms of portfolio and resume building. Even the students who weren’t as motivated as I would have liked are objectively more prepared for the job market than they were before the class started, so I love the idea of building digital competencies into the curriculum. I’m going to continue using these projects the next time I teach consumer behavior, and will add more opportunities for students to build digital competencies into my other classes. For example, I’m thinking about having my market research and/or my MBA class create a Facebook Fan Page so they’ll be able to analyze the relevant metrics and make decisions and changes using data that’s relevant to them. I’m really grateful to have had the opportunity to talk about these initiatives with other faculty and staff, so I really appreciate #DigPINS for giving me the resources and motivation to do so. I probably wouldn’t have done as much or been as successful without yall!\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\n#DigPINS 2019\nNext Post\nChanging Circumstances: Unexpected Benefits\n(4) Comments\nReid\nDecember 25, 2019 at 5:45 pm\nReply\nA strong articulation of the value of digital competencies, Miles!

I think I’m going to have to work out the logistics a bit better. I think I’m going to make the website a shorter assignment and only give them half the semester instead of the whole thing, so they don’t spread out the work too much and not retain as much. Strangely, I’m going to have to be a lot more strict with deadlines. I was very flexible given the nature of the assignments, which students didn’t like. Even though I never took points off for being late or changed a deadline to make it due sooner, students needed more structure. I’m looking forward to doing it again.

Susan Ashley was an incredible resource and offered many suggestions of how to accomplish this, including in integrating the Seesaw platform into my\nEDUC 317 General Music in the Elementary School\ncourse.  Through the use of this intuitive online platform I was able to film and easily share footage of the fourteen teachers-in-training demonstrating their competencies in “micro-teach” episodes.  Each student completed a total of five of these teaching demonstrations throughout the semester.  Students received feedback from me and also completed self-reflections and peer-to-peer evaluations.  Seesaw allowed me to easily organize, share, and evaluate their work.  For their final microteach Susan filmed all of the demonstrations using the 360 camera to allow students the opportunity to think critically about the teaching environment in their classroom as a whole, and not just to focus exclusively on their role as facilitators in the classroom.\nAt the conclusion of Fall 2019 I now have a total of 140 pieces of evidence that is organized in the Seesaw platform.  As this course has a second part (\nEDUC 318 General Music in the Secondary School\n), one of the goals will be to introduce both the Seesaw platform along with several other relevant digital music curriculum resources to students so that they can integrate these into their own classrooms in the future.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nWeek 4!

{"id":"279f0446-d5f1-460d-9d11-cd0681b11bcb","url":"https://snc.digpins.org/my-journey-with-digpins-round-2/?replytocom=348","title":"My Journey with #digPINS…Round 2! – SNC #DigPINS","text":"Home\n>\nBlog\n>\nImplementation Report\n>\nMy Journey with #digPINS…Round 2!\nThis past (crazy) semester I embarked on another digital journey with other faculty and staff from St. Norbert College. My particular project focused on my Ethnic Geography course and me utilizing my own Domain (website) more during the course. This was important to me because I felt like I needed to practice what I was preaching. In the course I ask students to create their own\n#knightdomain\nto host their own learning artifacts from my course. This is new to many of our students, and so they need focus on both content and\nBryn Mawr learning objectives\n. In the past, class information was put onto Moodle (or Google Classroom), and I felt that making this course design change gave me both more credibility with my students and also made me understand some of their potential challenges with developing and building a Domain.\nBryn Mawr Digital Competencies\nUltimately, the project tied nicely into each of the skills in the Bryn Mawr framework. First, the project tied to\nDigital Survival Skills\nas it involved at time uploading files. @TaylorJadin and Susan Ashley often helped me better understand items such as embedding PDF files, Google Docs, and Word Docs. This tooks some maneuvering as well with learning some basic code as the Google Doc’s often appeared very small on my domain and I wanted them to have more “full screen” features. Troubleshooting with SNC’s TechBar team was essential in this project and process for me and it also proved that life-long learning is really essential in everything educational – including digital skills. This first skill also helped me in developing and starting to manage my own digital identity which was complex as I wanted to both showcase my skills to other scholars and employers online as well as be effective platforms of sharing information with my students at SNC. It was great to have the experience of building this with experts who could really assist me with the process. Without them, I would not have been successful.\nMy domain also hosts a few blogs, which is something that I also ask students to do in my own courses and ties to\nDigital Communication\n. Writing blogs and hosting them on my domain was just another example of modeling for students and me also gaining perspective on the process. At times there was trouble shooting in this process as well trying to embed my Twitter feed with limited success on my own. The #TechBarStudents were very helpful to me in this process, and I know that quite a few of my students needed help with embedding Twitter on their Domains.\nDigital Management and Preservation\nwasn’t a main focus but certainly present in my Domain. As we speak, I’m trying to copy my Domain to my own platform for life (unfortunately) after SNC. There were also times that I worked with @TaylorJadin to back up my website before making modifications.\nData Analysis and Presentation\nalso wasn’t a main focus…but we did add JetPack to each of my subdomains to have an idea of how often and which pages were the most utilized on my domain.\nCritical Making, Design and Development\nwas more of an essential component in my project. There were times that I talked with @ReidRiggle about the overall organization and appearance on the website, along with @TaylorJadin. This was a process and something that continuously evolved, including a few theme changes.\nOverall this project was very collaborative with various members of the SNC campus and I’m very grateful for the opportunity to improve my own skills and also to better understand the hiccups and areas where my students need help in creating their own domains.\nElevating Student Learning\nHaving my own Domain enabled me to have an example for students and show modeling. When I asked them to organize their own Domain’s they were able to see my own organizational features such as my drop down menus. They also saw how my information was not just on my home page but that I had different sections devoted to different aspects of my course. While Moodle and Google Classroom are learning platforms, I also felt that having my own Domain elevated student learning by having more of a “student friendly” platform. I believe the Domain was more visually pleasing and allowed me as a professor more freedom to organize the course – which ultimately elevated student learning as course information was easier to follow from a student perspective. Throughout the course, my students have to tie their artifacts to digital learning objectives from the Bryn Mawr Framework, and it was a great experience for me to practice digital learning along with them.\nWays to improve and what’s next?\nThis semester was crazy, to say the least. In a “normal” semester, I would have loved to create my own podcast. Many of my students use this digital artifact on their Domain and it’s an area where I always seem to be giving tips…so it would have been great to dip my toe in the water and do a podcast. In the future and with more time, this is an area where I would like to grow and where I would like to ultimately use my podcast as an example for students.\nWith the shift in the semester, I also found myself really having to change some of my delivery methods (which also fits in nicely with the Bryn Mawr Framework) and therefore I did not have time to gather a lot of feedback from students in terms of the organization of my website and what could be improved.\nMy plan is to continue using my domain this next school year wherever I “land” and continue utilizing the skills and tools that I’ve learned throughout this process. Thanks again SNC for this experience!\nBibliography for images:\ndigPINS image from\nhttps://autummcaines.com/digpins/\nBryn Mawr Framework from\nhttps://techbar.knight.domains/bryn-mawr-framework/\nThinking emoji\nhttps://imgflip.com/memetemplate/81561879/Thinking-emoji\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nUsing Google Tools to Promote Academic Integrity and Knowledge of Social Science\nNext Post\nPANDEMIC!?!

Marketing is becoming increasingly digital, and marketing programs need to update their curriculum in order to give students the skills necessary to respond to the changing industry (Rohm, Stefl, and Saint Clair 2019). The purpose of marketing education is to provide students with the skills and tools necessary to succeed as marketers, so it is essential that marketing programs adapt to the rapidly digitized marketing industry (Brennan 2012). An important component of offering students a valuable learning experience is to provide them opportunities to build their digital competencies to help them thrive in the digital world post-graduation. Students are increasingly required to manage and preserve data, to communicate digitally, to analyze and present data, to manage digital identities, and to make critical design and development decisions in a digital space (“Bryn Mawr Digital Competencies Framework” 2016). In order to keep marketing programs relevant, students must be given the opportunity to build these competencies while still in school.\nI used my Consumer Behavior marketing class to provide students with three opportunities to build digital competencies. First, students completed two digital marketing certifications (HubSpot social media certification and Google Analytics beginner certification) that are highly regarded in the industry and often required for digital marketing positions. Research also shows that these certifications help with job placement and success in the position (Staton 2016). Not only did this assignment force students to build their resume and be more attractive candidates on the job market, but it also allowed me to flip the classroom for that unit and give them a project to apply the knowledge they learned from the certifications. Specifically, I gave students real social media and website data from a local nonprofit that they were able to analyze and come up with recommendations for. I was fortunate enough to have access to these data and permission to share them, but it could have easily been done with fabricated data too.\nSecond, students applied the material we learned in class to develop a website for a brand of their own creation. Students were given the option to develop a website for a personal brand to promote themselves on the job market, for a brand for a company they want to actually create in the future, or for a fictitious brand (e.g., a fake clothing store). The college offers the Knight Domains service to students, which gives them server space and resources so they can develop their own websites or applications. The Tech Bar offers consultation and training in WordPress and its applications for students so over the course of the semester, students updated their websites and created their brand. Students also wrote five blog posts over the course of the semester and posted them to their sites. The first blog post was an intention post, where they created three personal learning objectives for assignment as well as tactics for accomplishing those objectives. Students then wrote three biweekly blog posts where they were required to relate the course content to their experience with creating the website. Finally, they were required to write a reflection blog post, where they had to reflect on whether they accomplished their learning objectives described in the intention post. After the semester, I got qualitative and quantitative data that suggested that students felt that they gained digital competencies and they felt more confident in their ability to be digital marketers after they graduate. I’ve submitted a proposal to present this at the Marketing Educators’ Association conference, so I’m hopeful I’ll be able to disseminate this and get more feedback on it in the spring.\nFinally, students completed the Buzzfeed Challenge (Cowley 2017), where they were required to identify a target market, create a BuzzFeed article or quiz that appeals to that market, and reach that market using online promotion principles and targeted influencer outreach. Their grade was, in part, determined by how many views they got (they needed at least 1000 views for full credit) and so their success was solely determined by the quality of the decisions they made. The number of views varied wildly, with a range of a couple hundred to more than 90,000! Students responded very positively to this assignment as well, and several students specifically said they learned more about marketing by doing the assignment.\nI was really happy with how these projects turned out. It really seemed like the students were really engaged with the assignments, and understood their importance in terms of portfolio and resume building. Even the students who weren’t as motivated as I would have liked are objectively more prepared for the job market than they were before the class started, so I love the idea of building digital competencies into the curriculum. I’m going to continue using these projects the next time I teach consumer behavior, and will add more opportunities for students to build digital competencies into my other classes. For example, I’m thinking about having my market research and/or my MBA class create a Facebook Fan Page so they’ll be able to analyze the relevant metrics and make decisions and changes using data that’s relevant to them. I’m really grateful to have had the opportunity to talk about these initiatives with other faculty and staff, so I really appreciate #DigPINS for giving me the resources and motivation to do so. I probably wouldn’t have done as much or been as successful without yall!\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\n#DigPINS 2019\nNext Post\nChanging Circumstances: Unexpected Benefits\n(4) Comments\nReid\nDecember 25, 2019 at 5:45 pm\nReply\nA strong articulation of the value of digital competencies, Miles!

This was a huge undertaking and a real revamping of your syllabus. Thank you for allowing St. Norbert College’s Academic Technology team and Full Spectrum Learning to be a part of this transformation. Part of SNC’s vision is to fully prepare students for success in a complex world. Your initiatives have given students the opportunity to gain digital skills necessary for the field of marketing and beyond. Great job!  If you were to change anything that you did during the course of the semester with this class, what would it be?\nMiles\nJanuary 6, 2020 at 2:59 pm\nThanks! I think I’m going to have to work out the logistics a bit better. I think I’m going to make the website a shorter assignment and only give them half the semester instead of the whole thing, so they don’t spread out the work too much and not retain as much. Strangely, I’m going to have to be a lot more strict with deadlines. I was very flexible given the nature of the assignments, which students didn’t like. Even though I never took points off for being late or changed a deadline to make it due sooner, students needed more structure. I’m looking forward to doing it again.

My section of this course incorporated service learning in its curriculum, and students that were enrolled in the course volunteered in either the bilingual classrooms at Danz Elementary, or in their after-school program. By using Spanish to help others, one of the objectives of this class was for students see the value and purpose of language learning beyond the traditional classroom setting.\nFrom experience teaching, as well as from information that I have read while working on my own scholarship, I have come to view writing as intricately linked to thinking and the act of processing information. The idea is that by writing, we learn to work through our thoughts and communicate our ideas. Thus, when designing this course and choosing an implementation project, I knew that I needed to include a way to help students process their thoughts and reflect on not only what they were learning, but also on how they were helping the students at Danz Elementary through service learning.\nThese initial thoughts on writing and reflection were further reinforced through the service-learning literature I read that stressed the importance of including critical reflection in experiential education and community-engaged courses. Some texts that have informed my thoughts on this matter include:\nJacoby, Barbara, and Jeffrey Howard.\nService-learning Essentials: Questions, Answers, and Lessons Learned\n. John Wiley & Sons, 2015.\nKobrin, Michael, Melissa Smith, and Joanna Mareth.\nIntroduction to Service-Learning Toolkit: Readings and Resources for Faculty\n. Campus Compact, 2000.\nRoberts, Jay W.\nExperiential Education in the College Context: What It Is, How It Works, and Why It Matters\n. Routledge, 2016.\nWhile I could have assigned papers or journal entries to achieve the desired learning outcome, I ultimately decided to incorporate a class blog because I wanted students to have a space to not only reflect on their own experience, but I wanted to give them the means to do so collectively with their peers. The blog created an additional sense of community and camaraderie among the students in the course, since it provided students with a way to continue to engage with each other beyond the class period and it gave them additional opportunities to share and exchange thoughts and information.\nIn doing so, this project closely aligns with point number two, Digital Communication, in Bryn Mawr’s Digital Competencies Framework. More specifically with\n2.1 Collaborative communication\nand\n2.2 Digital writing and publishing\n. Through the blogs, students became familiar with the publishing tools in WordPress (in Spanish!), and they learned how to effectively communicate their ideas through their blog posts. I observed that for students this often involved not only developing a clear and informative writing style, but also an aesthetically pleasing post that visually communicates and compliments the ideas that the student expressed in their writing. Students also worked together in a collaborative fashion, commenting on the ideas and points brought up by their peers about their service-learning experience. It bears repeating that in this way they could express themselves individually, while also processing the service-learning experience together in a digital space.\nIn regards to implementation and assessment, Taylor helped me develop the expectations for the blog portion of the course and worked with my students to teach them how to post their reflections and comment on the posts of their peers (Thank you, Taylor!). It was decided that as long as students met the word length, and demonstrated that they were reflecting on both their experiences and on the experiences of others to their fullest capabilities, they would receive full credit. It was interesting to read the blogs and see how their relationships grew with the students at Danz over the semester, how they gained more confidence in themselves, and how they acquired new perspectives from their experiences.\nThe implementation of this technology had multiple benefits and helped students to meet other course objectives for Spanish 300. For instance, by giving students additional practice in the target language beyond the instructional setting, students greatly improved their ability to communicate in Spanish, which in turn gave them more faith in their language skills. In addition, by helping students process their thoughts and ideas, by the end of the semester students were able to successfully articulate how this service-learning experience helped the community, and how it changed them as individuals. The final reflection papers from this course were moving and it was apparent that students were profoundly affected by their experiences within the community. I believe that the blogs were instrumental in helping students achieve the level of depth and reflection that they demonstrated by the end of the semester.\nThank you, #DigPINS / ITS for all your help, resources, and strong commitment to student learning! None of this would be possible without you.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nTransitioning to Online Teaching\nNext Post\nEnhancing Student Engagement to Promote Deep Learning\n(1) Comment\nSusan Ashley\nApril 21, 2020 at 2:56 pm\nReply\nKatie,\nBlogs can be so powerful when used as a reflection piece for a course. Using this intentional and skilled activity can have a huge impact on student learning. As noted, with composing blogs, students had increased opportunity to use their target language in an authentic way, while building communio with their classmates. This experience has indeed fostered learning of digital communication skills with the writing and publishing of the blogs. Great job, Katie. This has been a huge success for you and your students, a wonderful way to elevate learning!

How do we continue to curate our presence? As\nPasquini\nstates, “We can no longer use the expression ‘in real life’ or IRL, as your online self\nis\nyour real, off-line self. In addition, how we behave inside the screen, on the web and in our networks has real-life implications for our selves outside a device, platform or digital space.”\nThis is very interesting to me because I can remember a time when there  was a clear distinction between our online selves and our IRL selves,  especially in the early days of Facebook and Twitter. I still find  myself wanting to take to the Internet with thoughts or opinions I  wouldn’t necessarily express IRL. As  a result, I am very interested in thinking about– as\nStewart\nasks, “who are you talking to?” when you sit down in front of a screen or swipe  up on your phone. And as we think about the spaces we hope to curate or  contribute to, I’m becoming increasingly interested (given our current  moment of #MeToo) to apply critical whiteness theory to my understanding  of digital identity. Critical whiteness theory is meant to reveal the  invisible structures that produce and reproduce white supremacy and  privilege. Even though women and people of color use the Internet to  share their stories, the Internet is still a place where people can be silenced. The Internet is not a guaranteed safe space for women and  people of color, just like IRL spaces can become unsafe. How do women  and people of color curate safe spaces or respond to unsafe spaces? Is  the only option to leave said spaces, as many are doing?\nFurthermore,  I was thinking during the visitor/resident discussion how our digital  identity is being tracked and we’re always leaving a trace, even if  we’re not engaging. What are those implications for our digital identity?  How does that affect the way we cultivate our presence online and  engage with others? The communities we enter? What is the role of  consent in our online spaces? In terms of IRL harassment and violence,  it’s not the dark alleys that are the most dangerous, it’s often the  places and people you know and trust, it’s the places you frequent, that  can become unsafe(est). These are a few of the things I’m interested in exploring during #DigPINS.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nANXIOUS BLOGGER\nNext Post\nExploring My Digital Identity\n(2) Comments\nTaylor Jadin\nJune 27, 2019 at 12:34 am\nReply\n“How do women and people of color curate safe spaces or respond to unsafe spaces?

Susan Ashley was an incredible resource and offered many suggestions of how to accomplish this, including in integrating the Seesaw platform into my\nEDUC 317 General Music in the Elementary School\ncourse.  Through the use of this intuitive online platform I was able to film and easily share footage of the fourteen teachers-in-training demonstrating their competencies in “micro-teach” episodes.  Each student completed a total of five of these teaching demonstrations throughout the semester.  Students received feedback from me and also completed self-reflections and peer-to-peer evaluations.  Seesaw allowed me to easily organize, share, and evaluate their work.  For their final microteach Susan filmed all of the demonstrations using the 360 camera to allow students the opportunity to think critically about the teaching environment in their classroom as a whole, and not just to focus exclusively on their role as facilitators in the classroom.\nAt the conclusion of Fall 2019 I now have a total of 140 pieces of evidence that is organized in the Seesaw platform.  As this course has a second part (\nEDUC 318 General Music in the Secondary School\n), one of the goals will be to introduce both the Seesaw platform along with several other relevant digital music curriculum resources to students so that they can integrate these into their own classrooms in the future.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nWeek 4!

You have created a safe space for exploring new ideas which motivates students to reach higher and thus continually grow in their teaching methods, both for them as educators and for their future students.  Getting feedback from the students from the 360 recordings may be quite interesting.

Many envision a science lecture and immediately mental images are conjured of multiple choice scantrons, long lists of taxonomic groups, and probably a balding professor with white beard and tweed jacket droning on in front of hundreds of students. Creativity is stifled because facts are facts and there is no room for interpretation. I read\nBut You Can’t Do That in a STEM course!\nand the many public annotations. I found myself writing and deleting comments and having a hard time putting my thoughts into words. As a biologist and someone who teaches the very same topics described in the article, I felt I needed to defend the way we do thing. The more I read and the more I re-read, I realized that maybe each teaching strategy is being viewed as if the entirety of the course if being taught that way. I have never taken a course where the professor stood up and just told me to memorize a list of items or that this sequence of topics is the only way to learn the material. As a wildlife geneticist I have had to memorize countless species names, structures, and biological processes “including all of the details of atomic structure, bonding, molecules, chemical properties, macromolecules like DNA, RNA, protein structure and function, cell structure and function, DNA replication, transcription, translation, cell cycle, etc.” But this was just one part of the learning process, and it wasn’t until I had an unexpected disconnect from the digital world that I was able to piece together some thoughts.\nLong story short, I was in the field with some students catching mice to estimate population size and doing a general biological inventory of the surrounding habitat. I was able to access mobile internet the year before but something was different and I could barely make voice calls. Oh and I was on an island 8 miles into the bay – but we did catch some cute critters.\nHiking about 8 miles a day gives you a lot of time to think and thoughts to rattle around in your brain. Open pedagogy, OER, rote memorization, inspiring lifelong learning… a little of that annoying song that wont get out of your head… that is what I thought about over several days. Turns out I was already engaging in open pedagogy through directed research. My students develop research questions and together we teak and existing project or create a new one to answer the question. My student likes birds, reptiles, amphibians, mammals? Well we don’t offer those courses (yet). I don’t know if you’ve ever done a biological inventory but it basically means hike around and ID whatever you can and use a field guide for whatever you can’t. Make notes about your observations, measure this, count that… it goes on. In way we were very much taking the same approach in Robin DeRosa’s\nMy Open Textbook: Pedagogy and Practice\nand allowing the students to fill in the gaps, learn the basics, and hopefully leave with an appreciation for the subject matter and desire to learn more on their own as we go through the scientific process and ultimately publish a report.\nDid this happen? Maybe. I could run this same study as a full semester course taking the same approach. Would the students leave as experts in wildlife and biodiversity? Probably not. At best they would be able to identify the species, behaviors, and environmental characteristics specific to that one environment. They may go off and try to learn more on their own but I have woefully underprepared them if they are to apply this in anything other than a mixed hardwood forest in Door County. Here is where I make my connection to the title of this blog. To say one thing is better or worse than another is like opening your tool box and saying a hammer is antiquated and you can’t just hammer everything to get the job done. Things hammered together are just going to fall apart in a short time. The reality, sometimes you need to hammer something together and sometimes you need to glue. Sometimes the job is done by a saw or some specialty tool. Pedagogy has to be the same. If my students had taken the time to memorize the calls of different birds, or the phylogenetic relationship among amphibians (literally just lists of things) then I could have better explained animal behavior or they could have asked better questions about ecology rather than “Dr. Brandt, what is this critter?” There is a time for rote memorization, and that shouldn’t be a bad thing. There is a time to allow students to take a topic and work through it backward, forward, sideways, or however they want. Sometime you need to cover topic in a specific order so you know the basics and can apply them in more complex situations.  We are the expert in these fields and we teach in that order, not because it is the only way, but because it is the most effective way to lead a novice through very complicated subjects. You start with molecules and bonds so that the student can not only grasp more complicated topics but to give them the tools necessary to make connections to new topics. If my student understands atomic structure and bonding first then they’re going to understand transcription and translation, which means they’re going to understand what it means when this cancer is caused by the overexpression of a particular gene but another cancer is caused by a failure in cell death signaling. I could even throw a hypothetical cancer into the mix and we could discuss how breakdowns in those basic processes will lead to the development of a tumor.\nI once had a conversation with a colleague about the future of education. He was convinced open learning platforms like Coursera would eliminate the need for us professors and brick and mortar institutions. I told him I wasn’t worried for the same reasons as above. All of these digital resources or only effective when applied in the right situation. As my students learned this past week, field work is hot, mosquito bites hurt, mice do not cooperate, and keying out trees is not that easy. They couldn’t learn this in an open course; however, there are courses like R programming, or bioinformatics that I would (and have) encouraged my students to take to augment the skills they gain here.\nI guess pedagogically speaking that makes Google search essentially duct tape.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nDigital pedagogy outside the classroom\nNext Post\nTeaching the Teachers\n(1) Comment\nBrian Clair\nDecember 1, 2020 at 5:36 am\nReply\nLearning a pedagogy is something new for me.

Her masters level students create podcasts about topics impacting today’s college students.  I appreciate this method of encouraging students to learn technology tools as well as to consider interacting with students outside of their own experience.  She is thinking outside the box in terms of how to help her students learn while sharing their learning with others.\nI enjoyed reading about Robin DeRosa’s experimentation with open textbooks.  In\nthis post\n, she wrote, “But a textbook is a textbook, and they saw it as neutral at best, uninspiring or frustrating at worst  I was just looking to replace a textbook and save some cash for strapped students. Boy, did I underestimate the power of the open textbook.”  There are so many connections between the type of work Robin DeRosa is doing with open textbooks with the work of academic service-learning. Robin is giving students an opportunity to really interact with the material.  They are helping others and making connections beyond sitting next to one another in a classroom. This learning is parallel to the learning done in academic service-learning.\nIn the article, “\nBut You Can’t Do That in a STEM Course\n,” Karen Cangialosi encourages the idea of having students share their research as they are developing it.  She writes, “ If we model ways for students to be transparent about all of the stages of the research process — encouraging them to publicly post and openly license their methodology and data long before it is polished into a final paper, they can receive broad and sometimes expert feedback on their work.”  That statement reminded me of part of Angela Duckworth’s book entitled\nGrit: The Power and Passion of Perseverance\n.  In the book, she shares about the process of developing\nher TedTalk\n.  She reflects on the fact that we do not see the iterations of talks that it took to get from the first draft to the final, polished product.  It takes perseverance to work behind the scenes to create a meaningful product. We should give students more opportunities for their work to be praised and critiqued in a public way as they are developing it.\nI will continue to reflect on how to use digital methods in the work I do outside of the classroom.  There are so many ways our students already connect to one another, how can we create more ways for them to connect with others outside of our campus?\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nBut I thought geography was just about maps?!\nNext Post\nPedagogy Toolbox\n(1) Comment\nSarah\nJuly 17, 2018 at 7:38 pm\nReply\nIs there a large field of scholarship on service learning?

Then, as is often the case, it was the end of the semester and I missed my opportunity. Thankfully I had plans to start using the same program with the Jazz Ensemble in the spring of 2020. For that course I was going to introduce some easy improvisation lessons (12-bar blues, ii-V-I progressions, etc.) and work on them as a group during rehearsals. All we had to do was get past the Winter Band Festival concert in mid-February and the Big Band Snowball in early March. Then I would be able to record the planned video to share. Long-story-short…no video. Classes have been moved on-line and I once again missed the opportunity.\nHowever, I was able to find other ways to reach students using the IPad during these unusual times. In Evolution of Jazz I will often sit at the piano and show the class how the music is put together or how one style differs from another. My piano skills are not particularly good (I’m a trombonist) but over the years I have found a few pieces that highlight different styles and can fumble my way through them while getting the point across. So in an attempt to share that experience with the students on-line, I set the IPad up on a music stand and recorded myself at the keyboard. After that it was easy to share with everyone in the course. So easy in fact that I think a great summer project will be recording a few more tunes and having them available for students to view before class or before exams. Stay tuned for more tunes!\nThis is the video introducing Modal Jazz to the class.\nSign in\nLoading…\n{\"id\": \"1DTgu5Zt1VQl0CU-Z1tdN3HJ8saEccWEZ\", \"title\": \"Modal Jazz introduction (So What \\x26 Impressions).MOV\", \"mimeType\": \"video\\/quicktime\"}\nDisplaying Modal Jazz introduction (So What & Impressions).MOV.\nIf the embedded video does not play for you, click here.\nFor reference, we just finished talking about much more complicated styles of jazz like Bebop, Cool, and Hard Bop. By contrast, Modal Jazz uses far fewer chords and requires a different approach from the soloists to maintain interest while the harmonies change more slowly.\nMy biggest takeaway from our DigPINS experience may be the flexibility gained by incorporating more technology in the classroom. I can always revert to more traditional methods when necessary but it is great to have these resources available when the time comes to try something differently.

Your video shows that lessons can still be taught in an online setting. I like how you keep your recorded lesson real and personable, while emphasizing the objectives you want students to take away from the lesson.  One question though,  using the Bryn Mawr Digital Competencies Framework, what skills would you identify align with your implementation of this initiative?\nEric High\nApril 24, 2020 at 3:34 pm\nReply\nOf course. Although this was my “emergency plan B”, I feel comfortable saying it fits (or gets close to) the following competencies:\nDigital Communication – While not exactly teaching the competency to the students, I had to deliver course material via digital media.\nData Analysis and Presentation – This might be closest to what I tried to accomplish if “data” can equal the description of the musical form and use of harmony.\nDigital Survival Skills – I was presented with an unusual, emergency-type of situation and needed to adapt immediately to get the course material to the students.\nI’m looking forward to finding more uses for the iPad and other technologies this fall.\nBrian Pirman\nMay 24, 2020 at 9:56 pm\nReply\nDon’t worry Eric.

Then, as is often the case, it was the end of the semester and I missed my opportunity. Thankfully I had plans to start using the same program with the Jazz Ensemble in the spring of 2020. For that course I was going to introduce some easy improvisation lessons (12-bar blues, ii-V-I progressions, etc.) and work on them as a group during rehearsals. All we had to do was get past the Winter Band Festival concert in mid-February and the Big Band Snowball in early March. Then I would be able to record the planned video to share. Long-story-short…no video. Classes have been moved on-line and I once again missed the opportunity.\nHowever, I was able to find other ways to reach students using the IPad during these unusual times. In Evolution of Jazz I will often sit at the piano and show the class how the music is put together or how one style differs from another. My piano skills are not particularly good (I’m a trombonist) but over the years I have found a few pieces that highlight different styles and can fumble my way through them while getting the point across. So in an attempt to share that experience with the students on-line, I set the IPad up on a music stand and recorded myself at the keyboard. After that it was easy to share with everyone in the course. So easy in fact that I think a great summer project will be recording a few more tunes and having them available for students to view before class or before exams. Stay tuned for more tunes!\nThis is the video introducing Modal Jazz to the class.\nSign in\nLoading…\n{\"id\": \"1DTgu5Zt1VQl0CU-Z1tdN3HJ8saEccWEZ\", \"title\": \"Modal Jazz introduction (So What \\x26 Impressions).MOV\", \"mimeType\": \"video\\/quicktime\"}\nDisplaying Modal Jazz introduction (So What & Impressions).MOV.\nIf the embedded video does not play for you, click here.\nFor reference, we just finished talking about much more complicated styles of jazz like Bebop, Cool, and Hard Bop. By contrast, Modal Jazz uses far fewer chords and requires a different approach from the soloists to maintain interest while the harmonies change more slowly.\nMy biggest takeaway from our DigPINS experience may be the flexibility gained by incorporating more technology in the classroom. I can always revert to more traditional methods when necessary but it is great to have these resources available when the time comes to try something differently.

Your video shows that lessons can still be taught in an online setting. I like how you keep your recorded lesson real and personable, while emphasizing the objectives you want students to take away from the lesson.  One question though,  using the Bryn Mawr Digital Competencies Framework, what skills would you identify align with your implementation of this initiative?\nEric High\nApril 24, 2020 at 3:34 pm\nReply\nOf course. Although this was my “emergency plan B”, I feel comfortable saying it fits (or gets close to) the following competencies:\nDigital Communication – While not exactly teaching the competency to the students, I had to deliver course material via digital media.\nData Analysis and Presentation – This might be closest to what I tried to accomplish if “data” can equal the description of the musical form and use of harmony.\nDigital Survival Skills – I was presented with an unusual, emergency-type of situation and needed to adapt immediately to get the course material to the students.\nI’m looking forward to finding more uses for the iPad and other technologies this fall.\nBrian Pirman\nMay 24, 2020 at 9:56 pm\nReply\nDon’t worry Eric.

I am very much out of my comfort zone when blogging so bear with me. Writing does not come very naturally to me, but I wanted to challenge myself with this. Enjoy my thoughts about week one!\nI am excited to explore Twitter. Up until now, I’ve had a personal account that I occasionally tweet on, but I have not thought of Twitter as a place to connect for pedagogy. I’m interested in discovering this side of Twitter. The handout by Laura Gogia also made me realize I’ve been using Twitter incorrectly. Instead of checking Twitter periodically throughout the day, I check it maybe once of week which is probably why I haven’t gotten the most out of my Twitter experience.\nI found the Visitor-Resident map very interesting to create. What I found surprising is how many digital resources I regularly use. I was happy to see that I am more of a visitor on most sites versus a resident. I would prefer to leave a smaller footprint on the website versus a larger one.\nMy personal VR map\nWhen I was watching the videos on mapping, it bothered me that David White kept referring to resident as the one that leaves a footprint after you log off and visitor does not. I understand what he meant by that, but it is important to note that everything we do on the website leaves a footprint whether we like it or not. One example of this is when we get ads of something we have recently searched. This data might not be visible to the general public, but it is visible to a few. What we do on the web is always somewhat trackable.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nWeek 1: complex digital identity\nNext Post\nThe Reluctant Self-Promoter\n(4) Comments\nAndrew\nJune 27, 2019 at 3:34 pm\nReply\nAnnicka, your words about the footprint we leave is very insightful.\nMy map looks like a few cacti in the dessert\nbut I realize, after seeing yours, that it probably is more of a forest than I thought.\nSusan Ashley\nJune 27, 2019 at 5:36 pm\nReply\nAnnicka,\nNice Map!

It is easy to forget sometimes that the V&R mapping process was created back in 2011 – While we knew back then that the tools on the web were tracking us people did not give it as much thought and there was much more trust in these tools. In recent years we have come to see what is possible with all of these data and that there are implications on both an individual level and societal level.\nShan Bryan-Hanson\nJuly 8, 2019 at 4:07 pm\nReply\nGreat drawing!

Maybe it will speak to others like me. Individuals\nwho roll their eyes at whatever new social media trend there is, people that\nscoff at blogs or vlogs, folks that grumble and mumble about millennials and\ntheir internet this-or-that. It all began with #DigPINS, some summer activity I\nthought would advance my teaching agenda. I still grumble about Twitter and\nother forms of social media but more importantly, I found myself connected to a\nnetwork of likeminded people (who are probably a little less curmudgeonly) with\na wide range of skills and interests in digital learning and pedagogy.\nI left #DigPINS and started the fall semester, a new course,\na global seminar– African Wildlife Conservation and Health. I had all of sorts\nof ideas bouncing around in the back of my head, things about digital literacy,\ndomains, and scholarship. I had no real intent of implementing any of those\nconcepts into my new course, until part way through the semester when a\ncolleague used the term “\ndisposable\nassignments\n.” I have assigned plenty of research papers over the years but\nnever considered that students did all of that work and I would be the only\nother person to ever see the product. This new course was meant to provide\nstudents with an opportunity to dive deep into some aspect of African wildlife\nthat would allow them to explore an area meaningful to them. This was the\nperfect place to utilize elements of open pedagogy and create something each\nclass could learn from and build on.\nA webpage! Or web based something? I could have students\nbuild their own sites and link them all together. I wasn’t off to a very good\nstart. I know some HTML, I was sure I could cobble together some assignment and\nget students doing more with the digital tools that were out there.\nMy lab website\nis\nhosted on Google Sites and every student at SNC has a Google account so this\ncould work? Everyone seems to be using WordPress these days, so maybe I should\nswitch to that, and what’s this Domain of One’s Own? So using this newly found\nnetwork I asked these questions. Actually what I asked was “Why use a\nDomain of\nOne’s Own\n… it’s just a website right?” The short answer is no, it isn’t\njust a website and be careful who you pose this question to or you’ll get quite\nthe earful. What I didn’t realize is that with Google Sites you get a very\nlimited webpage building tool, and with Domains you get access to all of the\nelements that allow you to develop nearly anything web based (within reason).\nYou have back door access to a platform with tools that could let you build a\nsimple web page, or an interactive site to collect data and run simulations, or\nperhaps deploy an app. You are really only limited by your own creative and\ntechnological abilities.\nThe Brandt Lab website created with Google Sites.\nReflection\nExploring the domains project, I was direct to\nKnight Domains\n. This is St. Norbert\nCollege’s initiative\n“that empowers\nstudents, faculty, and staff to take responsibility for a little piece of the\ninternet that they can call their own.”\nI explored the different tools\navailable attempting to find something that I could use for my course.\nWordPress\n(a blogging application) came\nhighly recommended and there are many\nexamples\nof other faculty using this tool. In case you missed my earlier grumblings, I\nwas not about to start blogging for my class (pay no attention to my current\nactions). In searching through the many other non-WordPress tools I came upon\ndokuwiki\n, an open source wiki\npublishing tool. This! This is what I needed to create some lasting and\nmeaningful assignment for my students. The basics of this tool is that I create\na\nsub-domain\nwithin my\nmain Knight Domain to host the wiki site and give it some sort of frame work\nthat the students can then build onto. For this course, I wanted students to be\nable to pick a topic, thoroughly research the subject, and create an informational\nwiki page\nakin to those on\nWikipedia\n.\nHomepage of the dokuwiki site at\nhttp://southafrica.adambrandt.knight.domains\nI was prepared for an uphill battle with my students.\nSometimes getting them to turn in an assignment as a PDF is a challenge and now\nI’m asking them to be creative, use a new\nsyntax\n,\nand develop something that could be seen by anyone. The fact that they struggle\nwith what should be simple digital skills is all the more reason to throw them\nhead first into this project. There was some guidance, sticking with the\ndigital theme I created a\ntutorial video\nto show them exactly how to get going on the project (I recommend playing at ½\nspeed unless you can easily follow what an auctioneer says – I talk really\nfast). Nonetheless, as students worked through this project they had the\nopportunity to build skills in two areas of\ndigital\ncompetencies\n.\nYouTube video tutorial on how to build content on the docuwiki platform.\nDigital\nSurvival Skills\n. Despite students growing up with ready access to computers\nor other devices, I find it surprising that this area remains a major challenge\nfor students. With such an open ended assignment and a novel platform, there\nare countless ways for things to go wrong. As students attempted to create or\nedit pages, some accidentally deleted parts of the site. Others would modify an\nimage only to crash the overall formatting. While the content was important,\nthe lesson focused more on learning how to\ntroubleshoot\ndigital problems. Once they managed to stop accidentally deleting things, they\nmoved into\nmetacognition\nand life-long learning\n. They were out of their element and they knew it.\nAfter I assured them that they couldn’t permanently hurt anything and after\nshowing them how to quickly resurrect deleted pages, they began identifying their\nown strength and weaknesses. I was expecting them to complete this project and\na grade was at stake, this was the true motivator. If they were to succeed they\nneeded to learn techniques for adding images, incorporating citations, and\nbetter understand the different dokuwiki tools. If they were going to finish\nthe project with a high grade they needed to find ways to improve their skills\nbeyond asking me how to do everything. The students spent more time reading the\ndocumentation, searching for solutions on the web, and even finding unique workarounds.\nDigital\nCommunication.\nSpecific to this competency were lessons in\ndigital\nwriting and publishing\n. Students had the opportunity to choose between\nusing the native dokuwiki syntax or a rich text editor wrapper. Spoiler alert\nthey chose the latter. Nevertheless, there were times when even the editor\ncaused problems and students needed to parse the syntax to get the page to\nappear as they desired. For most this was the first experience with any sort of\nprogramming language. They may not be experts at it, but now they know how to do\nsome basic level coding and they can use this knowledge on something like that reliable\nbut ancient piece of equipment every lab seems to have still running MS DOS.\nDigital Competencies. Image credit Bryn Mawr College\nConclusion\nAll in all, the first pass at this project didn’t take too long to\nprepare or implement. I spent some time doing some behind the scenes work and\ntidying up the site, but the end result is a good start. Eight really\nwell-crafted pages on topics relating to African wildlife conservation and\nhealth etched into a corner of the web that will remain for some time. At the\nvery least my current students learned some new tools and hopefully some skills\nthat will benefit them in the future. In the next iteration of the course,\nstudents will have the opportunity to learn from what was done and further build\non this growing body of knowledge.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\n21st Century Digital Scholarship\nNext Post\nMy #DigPINS experience\n(2) Comments\nReid Riggle\nMay 1, 2019 at 12:00 pm\nReply\nThanks for having the courage to consider and explore new ideas that can elevate student learning, Adam.

Lately, I have been thinking about how what I consume on the web affects me, or how my “online” self affects my “offline” self.\nI have always enjoyed reading news articles and blog posts on the internet. I’ve made a habit of frequently reading blogs and news sites on various topics that interest me (mostly tech, education and music) since high school. For me this behavior has not changed,\nI still read a lot of articles and blog posts, but the\nway\nI consume the majority of my written content on the web\nhas\nchanged.\nGood ol’ bookmarks\nFirefox 1.5, with glorious tabbed browsing. A blast from the past.\nSource\nI used to simply have a folder of bookmarks that I would visit (one at a time) when I was looking for something to read. Eventually I was able to use browser tabs to make it easy to open multiple sites at once!\nGoogle Reader (and RSS!)\nSource\nThen I discovered\nGoogle Reader\n, an RSS reader, which allows you to subscribe to posts from your favorite sites and have them delivered to you in an inbox of sorts. This was great because it allowed me to subscribe to a much wider variety of sources to read and it even worked pretty well on my iPod Touch.\n1st gen iPod Touch. More nostalgia.\nSource\nGoogle Reader was a cool service at the time, but I had some problems with my own usage of RSS. I began to treat it like work. It felt like I had to at least skim each and every article that came through to zero out my inbox of articles. This type of thinking caused me to abandon the idea of using Google Reader or other RSS readers and instead I transitioned my reading back to just visiting sites by typing them into the address bar of my browser.\nThe Problem\nSource\nSoon, as social media platforms became more popular I began to find myself spending more time there and transitioning more of my reading time away from individual sites. Jumping forward to about 6 months ago I realized that I was seeking out way less individual news sources than I ever had and instead spent most of my reading time on Twitter, Facebook and Reddit. I noticed that the news sites I did intentionally visit were whittled down to only a few because it was easier to just visit Twitter and Reddit.\nThis all makes sense. Platforms like these live and die on their ability to keep people engaged. The business models of these sites are based around getting you to spend more time on them, so that you view and engage with advertisements they get paid to display. These sites are engineered to make you want to visit them as often as possible and for you to feel like there is always more to discover on them.\nWhy does it matter?\nThe media I consume online is certainly one of the ingredients that make up my persona. At the risk of sounding dramatic, why wouldn’t I want to have control over that part of what makes me, me? That being said, I know that I don’t want to just stop reading articles and blog posts, so I needed something else to shift those habits over to.\n1\nTiny Tiny RSS\nTiny Tiny RSS hosted on my domain at reader.jadin.me\nThis is where RSS readers (remember Google Reader?) come back in to importance for me. Unfortunately Google Reader has been\ndiscontinued since 2013\nso I started my search for something to replace it. I tried several platforms like\nFeedly\n,\nInoreader\n, and\nNewsBlur\n. While these RSS readers mostly worked how I’d like them to\n2\nI felt as long as I was going to take ownership over what I read, I should take ownership of the tool I would use to do my reading as well. For me this meant that I should go with something that I could host on my own domain.\nAfter some more research I decided on Tiny Tiny RSS, which I set up with my favorite blogs and news sources at\nreader.jadin.me\n. After some tinkering I got everything working the way I like AND I solved my problem with feeling stressed out by the number of unread items using this thought technology:\n3\nI don’t need to read everything in my RSS reader. It is both OK and totally healthy to hit the “Mark as Read” button on occasion.\nIts stupid that I couldn’t come to terms with this earlier, but thats sometimes how my brain works.\n4\nAnother tactic that helps me here is to organize the larger news sites and smaller blogs into their own respective categories. This makes it easier to simply skim the headlines of the news websites while still catching every post from blogs I really care about.\nFinal Thoughts\nHas this been successful? So far, I think so. I definitely spend much more of my reading time in Tiny Tiny RSS, which I have set up with a much more diverse set of news sources and blogs and its usually the first place I will go when I’m looking for something to read. I’m also very satisfied with the\nAndroid app\nfor use on my phone, which is important because I probably read more from my phone than from a laptop or desktop nowadays. In addition to this I spend more time reading stuff from individual people writing about educational technology and the web itself,\n5\nwhich feels like time better spent.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nDigital Identities and “Real” Selves\nNext Post\nTo interact, or not to interact…. that is the question!\n(2) Comments\nC-C\nJanuary 16, 2019 at 2:23 am\nReply\nTaylor, Thanks for this blog.

Then, as is often the case, it was the end of the semester and I missed my opportunity. Thankfully I had plans to start using the same program with the Jazz Ensemble in the spring of 2020. For that course I was going to introduce some easy improvisation lessons (12-bar blues, ii-V-I progressions, etc.) and work on them as a group during rehearsals. All we had to do was get past the Winter Band Festival concert in mid-February and the Big Band Snowball in early March. Then I would be able to record the planned video to share. Long-story-short…no video. Classes have been moved on-line and I once again missed the opportunity.\nHowever, I was able to find other ways to reach students using the IPad during these unusual times. In Evolution of Jazz I will often sit at the piano and show the class how the music is put together or how one style differs from another. My piano skills are not particularly good (I’m a trombonist) but over the years I have found a few pieces that highlight different styles and can fumble my way through them while getting the point across. So in an attempt to share that experience with the students on-line, I set the IPad up on a music stand and recorded myself at the keyboard. After that it was easy to share with everyone in the course. So easy in fact that I think a great summer project will be recording a few more tunes and having them available for students to view before class or before exams. Stay tuned for more tunes!\nThis is the video introducing Modal Jazz to the class.\nSign in\nLoading…\n{\"id\": \"1DTgu5Zt1VQl0CU-Z1tdN3HJ8saEccWEZ\", \"title\": \"Modal Jazz introduction (So What \\x26 Impressions).MOV\", \"mimeType\": \"video\\/quicktime\"}\nDisplaying Modal Jazz introduction (So What & Impressions).MOV.\nIf the embedded video does not play for you, click here.\nFor reference, we just finished talking about much more complicated styles of jazz like Bebop, Cool, and Hard Bop. By contrast, Modal Jazz uses far fewer chords and requires a different approach from the soloists to maintain interest while the harmonies change more slowly.\nMy biggest takeaway from our DigPINS experience may be the flexibility gained by incorporating more technology in the classroom. I can always revert to more traditional methods when necessary but it is great to have these resources available when the time comes to try something differently.

Your video shows that lessons can still be taught in an online setting. I like how you keep your recorded lesson real and personable, while emphasizing the objectives you want students to take away from the lesson.

Maybe it will speak to others like me. Individuals\nwho roll their eyes at whatever new social media trend there is, people that\nscoff at blogs or vlogs, folks that grumble and mumble about millennials and\ntheir internet this-or-that. It all began with #DigPINS, some summer activity I\nthought would advance my teaching agenda. I still grumble about Twitter and\nother forms of social media but more importantly, I found myself connected to a\nnetwork of likeminded people (who are probably a little less curmudgeonly) with\na wide range of skills and interests in digital learning and pedagogy.\nI left #DigPINS and started the fall semester, a new course,\na global seminar– African Wildlife Conservation and Health. I had all of sorts\nof ideas bouncing around in the back of my head, things about digital literacy,\ndomains, and scholarship. I had no real intent of implementing any of those\nconcepts into my new course, until part way through the semester when a\ncolleague used the term “\ndisposable\nassignments\n.” I have assigned plenty of research papers over the years but\nnever considered that students did all of that work and I would be the only\nother person to ever see the product. This new course was meant to provide\nstudents with an opportunity to dive deep into some aspect of African wildlife\nthat would allow them to explore an area meaningful to them. This was the\nperfect place to utilize elements of open pedagogy and create something each\nclass could learn from and build on.\nA webpage! Or web based something? I could have students\nbuild their own sites and link them all together. I wasn’t off to a very good\nstart. I know some HTML, I was sure I could cobble together some assignment and\nget students doing more with the digital tools that were out there.\nMy lab website\nis\nhosted on Google Sites and every student at SNC has a Google account so this\ncould work? Everyone seems to be using WordPress these days, so maybe I should\nswitch to that, and what’s this Domain of One’s Own? So using this newly found\nnetwork I asked these questions. Actually what I asked was “Why use a\nDomain of\nOne’s Own\n… it’s just a website right?” The short answer is no, it isn’t\njust a website and be careful who you pose this question to or you’ll get quite\nthe earful. What I didn’t realize is that with Google Sites you get a very\nlimited webpage building tool, and with Domains you get access to all of the\nelements that allow you to develop nearly anything web based (within reason).\nYou have back door access to a platform with tools that could let you build a\nsimple web page, or an interactive site to collect data and run simulations, or\nperhaps deploy an app. You are really only limited by your own creative and\ntechnological abilities.\nThe Brandt Lab website created with Google Sites.\nReflection\nExploring the domains project, I was direct to\nKnight Domains\n. This is St. Norbert\nCollege’s initiative\n“that empowers\nstudents, faculty, and staff to take responsibility for a little piece of the\ninternet that they can call their own.”\nI explored the different tools\navailable attempting to find something that I could use for my course.\nWordPress\n(a blogging application) came\nhighly recommended and there are many\nexamples\nof other faculty using this tool. In case you missed my earlier grumblings, I\nwas not about to start blogging for my class (pay no attention to my current\nactions). In searching through the many other non-WordPress tools I came upon\ndokuwiki\n, an open source wiki\npublishing tool. This! This is what I needed to create some lasting and\nmeaningful assignment for my students. The basics of this tool is that I create\na\nsub-domain\nwithin my\nmain Knight Domain to host the wiki site and give it some sort of frame work\nthat the students can then build onto. For this course, I wanted students to be\nable to pick a topic, thoroughly research the subject, and create an informational\nwiki page\nakin to those on\nWikipedia\n.\nHomepage of the dokuwiki site at\nhttp://southafrica.adambrandt.knight.domains\nI was prepared for an uphill battle with my students.\nSometimes getting them to turn in an assignment as a PDF is a challenge and now\nI’m asking them to be creative, use a new\nsyntax\n,\nand develop something that could be seen by anyone. The fact that they struggle\nwith what should be simple digital skills is all the more reason to throw them\nhead first into this project. There was some guidance, sticking with the\ndigital theme I created a\ntutorial video\nto show them exactly how to get going on the project (I recommend playing at ½\nspeed unless you can easily follow what an auctioneer says – I talk really\nfast). Nonetheless, as students worked through this project they had the\nopportunity to build skills in two areas of\ndigital\ncompetencies\n.\nYouTube video tutorial on how to build content on the docuwiki platform.\nDigital\nSurvival Skills\n. Despite students growing up with ready access to computers\nor other devices, I find it surprising that this area remains a major challenge\nfor students. With such an open ended assignment and a novel platform, there\nare countless ways for things to go wrong. As students attempted to create or\nedit pages, some accidentally deleted parts of the site. Others would modify an\nimage only to crash the overall formatting. While the content was important,\nthe lesson focused more on learning how to\ntroubleshoot\ndigital problems. Once they managed to stop accidentally deleting things, they\nmoved into\nmetacognition\nand life-long learning\n. They were out of their element and they knew it.\nAfter I assured them that they couldn’t permanently hurt anything and after\nshowing them how to quickly resurrect deleted pages, they began identifying their\nown strength and weaknesses. I was expecting them to complete this project and\na grade was at stake, this was the true motivator. If they were to succeed they\nneeded to learn techniques for adding images, incorporating citations, and\nbetter understand the different dokuwiki tools. If they were going to finish\nthe project with a high grade they needed to find ways to improve their skills\nbeyond asking me how to do everything. The students spent more time reading the\ndocumentation, searching for solutions on the web, and even finding unique workarounds.\nDigital\nCommunication.\nSpecific to this competency were lessons in\ndigital\nwriting and publishing\n. Students had the opportunity to choose between\nusing the native dokuwiki syntax or a rich text editor wrapper. Spoiler alert\nthey chose the latter. Nevertheless, there were times when even the editor\ncaused problems and students needed to parse the syntax to get the page to\nappear as they desired. For most this was the first experience with any sort of\nprogramming language. They may not be experts at it, but now they know how to do\nsome basic level coding and they can use this knowledge on something like that reliable\nbut ancient piece of equipment every lab seems to have still running MS DOS.\nDigital Competencies. Image credit Bryn Mawr College\nConclusion\nAll in all, the first pass at this project didn’t take too long to\nprepare or implement. I spent some time doing some behind the scenes work and\ntidying up the site, but the end result is a good start. Eight really\nwell-crafted pages on topics relating to African wildlife conservation and\nhealth etched into a corner of the web that will remain for some time. At the\nvery least my current students learned some new tools and hopefully some skills\nthat will benefit them in the future. In the next iteration of the course,\nstudents will have the opportunity to learn from what was done and further build\non this growing body of knowledge.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\n21st Century Digital Scholarship\nNext Post\nMy #DigPINS experience\n(2) Comments\nReid Riggle\nMay 1, 2019 at 12:00 pm\nReply\nThanks for having the courage to consider and explore new ideas that can elevate student learning, Adam.

Specifically, the idea of our Public Learning Network (PLN). Despite a robust appetite for talking with strangers and for broadcasting minutiae to social media, the idea of “networking” makes me weary. I imagined networking in the context of late 20\nth\ncentury corporate culture: putting on a power suit, schmoozing, and assessing people in transactional terms. Tonight, I read something that helped me recognize how silly and narrow that idea is.\nThe transformative text came from the introduction to adrienne maree brown’s book\nEmergent Strategy: Shaping Change, Changing Worlds\n. In her poetic, free flowing introduction, brown talked about the path and people that led her to learn about “emergent strategy” and to write the book. She named some of the women who were her teachers and mentors and discussed their work. Chief among them\nMargaret Wheatley\n,\nGrace Lee Boggs\n, and\nOctavia Butler.\nIt was in brown’s discussion of Wheatley’s work (as introduced to her by Boggs) and the focus on “critical connections instead of critical mass” that spoke to me. In her book\nLeadership and the New Science\n, Wheatley introduces ideas of what brown describes as “biomimicry and mushroom magic.” These words sparked in me a vision of bright* mycelium, branching and connecting through dark soil, building a resilient web of slender threads: a network that feeds and nourishes not only the fungal body but also the other species surrounding it. Much of our culture seems to be rooted (pun intended) in a mindset of scarcity and competition. This idea of mycelial growth moves me: networks as born of and generating abundance rather than scarcity. brown describes it succinctly: Relationships are everything.\nMycelium\nby\nKirill Ignatyev\nis licensed under (\nCC BY-NC 2.0\n).\nTo bring it back to #DigPINS, I’ve struggled with the question of who makes up my PLN or, in the absence of such a cluster, who would I like to have in it and how I’d reach them? When I consider a PLN as the intellectual (and possibly spiritual) equivalent of mycelial growth that might lead to visible fruit (fungi, y’all!), I start to get a clearer sense of who and what I’m looking for. Also helpful, this metaphor helps me frame how I might approach people in and around my field in a spirit of abundance and critical connections rather than with the mindset of competition and scarcity. The “declaration” of Bonnie Stewart’s steps for getting started in a network.\nTo go one step further, and take a stab at\nJoe’s suggestion to write until you know what you’ll write about next\n: I’m excited to explore the vision of “mushroom magic” as it might pertain to and strengthen the culture of an online classroom.\n* – Before anyone comments to tell me that mycelium are not bright because they’re underground: it’s a vision, let’s allow for a little poetic license in the telling.\nletterpress terrarium\nby\nkt.ries\nis licensed under (\nCC BY-NC 2.0\n).\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nZone of proximal development\nNext Post\nEntering the Labyrinth\n(3) Comments\nReid\nJune 28, 2018 at 2:48 pm\nReply\nI appreciate the imagery and the “positive flip” in your thinking.\nShan Bryan-Hanson\nJune 28, 2018 at 4:20 pm\nReply\nLove this–“These words sparked in me a vision of bright* mycelium, branching and connecting through dark soil, building a resilient web of slender threads: a network that feeds and nourishes not only the fungal body but also the other species surrounding it.

A few interesting readings, a visitor resident map, slack discussions, and finally putting off my blog post until I have had a chance to see how the crowd was positioned before I shouted my thoughts into cyberspace. In real life… sorry IRL I enjoy the quiet and I would much rather spend my time with a few friends having a drink on the back porch or in some wilderness far from civilization. When planning a vacation big cities are on the bottom of the list – I grew up a short drive from DC, Pittsburgh, and Baltimore yet visited all of them collectively less than a dozen times. I think this identity translates well to my digital identity and explains most of my online habits. Any time I begin to engage in any form of social media I almost immediately become this guy:\nMost of the internet I am a visitor. Any place I am a resident is focused on interacting with that small group of friends and family or to promote myself professionally. I seek places on the web where I can accomplish a task without much interaction with others. Just as I get overwhelmed in a city with all the noise, hustle, and bustle, I find find some digital environments to be the same so I avoid them. So now week 1 is done and it is time to get introspective. Who am I online and what does this mean for pedagogy? My digital identity is more or less a hermit, I come out now and then to be reminded about what I am missing then I retreat to my cave (credit to Mitchell Scott’s much better prairie dog analogy). I use digital tools necessary to accomplish my research or teaching. As an instructor or collaborator, I need to consider other’s digital identity to be effective in my teaching and research. I might prefer the quiet, but every now and then you need to venture into the city.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nEmbracing the Digital Game\nNext Post\nZone of proximal development\n(2) Comments\nautumm\nJune 27, 2018 at 3:01 am\nReply\nThanks for this reflection Adam. Though you describe yourself as leaning more visitor I think you have the great makings of a resident if you so desire.  One thing that drives me nuts about a lot of resident activity is that much of it can be sort of thoughtless. Being resident is not about pushing content it is about creating meaningful connections with content and with other people.\nEven if you decide that being resident in public is not for you I think that the skills and tools of residency would serve you well in making connections with your students.\nNice gif use btw\nShan Bryan-Hanson\nJune 28, 2018 at 4:28 pm\nReply\n” I enjoy the quiet and I would much rather spend my time with a few friends having a drink on the back porch or in some wilderness far from civilization.”   I relate to the need for quiet spaces.  As a result, I’ve found I’m very much a visitor when it comes to my personal life and more of a resident regarding things related to my field.\nLeave a Reply to\nautumm\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\nWrite a Comment...\nEmail (Required)\nName (Required)\nWebsite\nLoading Comments...\nComment\n×\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

I want one of those: The Library’s role in OER – SNC #DigPINS","text":"Home\n>\nBlog\n>\nPedagogy\n>\nHey! I want one of those: The Library’s role in OER\nWhen participating in DigPins was originally pitched to me, I had some hesitations. See, I’m one of those librarians that has carefully guided their career to avoid the inside of a classroom—we exist mostly on the collection/tech side of libraries.  Despite avoiding the classroom, I have become interested in what is going on in the classroom, especially around OER, textbook affordability, and library resources.  While we have focused on the beneficial partnership between open pedagogy and OER, I thinks it is also important to dig into what might be the first step of this process for many—finding and adopting an OER.\nFinding an OER you want to use is often the most difficult step of the process. In fact, for three straight years in a\nsurvey on OER in US higher ed.\nfaculty members have reported it as the biggest barrier to adoption.\nLibraries and librarians are playing a key role in OER discovery by assisting with the development of platforms like the\nOpen Textbook Library\nand by becoming participating members in the\nOpen Textbook Network.\nLibrarians are also serving as curators of OER resource lists for their campuses—\nUW-Milwaukee\nand\nNC State\n– and by preserving and storing OERs in library managed institutional repositories. By placing OERs in institutional repositories, they are preserved locally and easily discoverable by local users with existing library search tools and broader user when institutional repositories are indexed and made discoverable via Google Scholar.\nWith some librarian meta-data and discovery know how, librarians are also creating homegrown solutions to search across the various platforms that contain OER materials. While not perfect, these sort of discovery interfaces take direct aim at the major barrier to adopting OER and bring in results from the various platforms that house OER materials in hopes of providing users with an easier discovery experience.  One example of this is\nGeorge Mason’s Metafinder tool.\nI know this deviates a bit from what’s at the heart of our discussion on open pedagogy and OER but my favorite example of libraries connecting users to alternatives for traditional textbooks–and a great example of the direction that textbook affordability will go until OER are more widely adopted–is what the University of South Florida Library is doing to push faculty members toward easily adopting\nE-books for the classroom\n.  (Disclaimer: The search within this platform provides results for both OER textbooks from the Open Textbook Library and Library e-books that are not available via open licensing. While not open like OER, Library e-books can be adopted by faculty and used at no cost to the student–well, the library pays for them but we have always said that our collections are based on the curriculum). From this one simple search platform, faculty members can identify relevant materials, adopt them for the classroom and get the necessary links to embed the materials in a syllabus and/or their course management system.  Pretty dope.

It also sounds similar to the peer instruction model. So there are a lot of folks out there who are having good results with team approaches to testing!\nIt’s neat to connect it to Vygotsky! It’s been long enough since I looked at that model that I tend to think of it as a personal zone, but of course that personal readiness to learn new things would be impacted by social relationships and support.\nReid\nJune 28, 2018 at 2:55 pm\nReply\nZPD is a very flexible concept.

I want one of those: The Library’s role in OER\nWhen participating in DigPins was originally pitched to me, I had some hesitations. See, I’m one of those librarians that has carefully guided their career to avoid the inside of a classroom—we exist mostly on the collection/tech side of libraries.  Despite avoiding the classroom, I have become interested in what is going on in the classroom, especially around OER, textbook affordability, and library resources.  While we have focused on the beneficial partnership between open pedagogy and OER, I thinks it is also important to dig into what might be the first step of this process for many—finding and adopting an OER.\nFinding an OER you want to use is often the most difficult step of the process. In fact, for three straight years in a\nsurvey on OER in US higher ed.\nfaculty members have reported it as the biggest barrier to adoption.\nLibraries and librarians are playing a key role in OER discovery by assisting with the development of platforms like the\nOpen Textbook Library\nand by becoming participating members in the\nOpen Textbook Network.\nLibrarians are also serving as curators of OER resource lists for their campuses—\nUW-Milwaukee\nand\nNC State\n– and by preserving and storing OERs in library managed institutional repositories. By placing OERs in institutional repositories, they are preserved locally and easily discoverable by local users with existing library search tools and broader user when institutional repositories are indexed and made discoverable via Google Scholar.\nWith some librarian meta-data and discovery know how, librarians are also creating homegrown solutions to search across the various platforms that contain OER materials. While not perfect, these sort of discovery interfaces take direct aim at the major barrier to adopting OER and bring in results from the various platforms that house OER materials in hopes of providing users with an easier discovery experience.  One example of this is\nGeorge Mason’s Metafinder tool.\nI know this deviates a bit from what’s at the heart of our discussion on open pedagogy and OER but my favorite example of libraries connecting users to alternatives for traditional textbooks–and a great example of the direction that textbook affordability will go until OER are more widely adopted–is what the University of South Florida Library is doing to push faculty members toward easily adopting\nE-books for the classroom\n.  (Disclaimer: The search within this platform provides results for both OER textbooks from the Open Textbook Library and Library e-books that are not available via open licensing. While not open like OER, Library e-books can be adopted by faculty and used at no cost to the student–well, the library pays for them but we have always said that our collections are based on the curriculum). From this one simple search platform, faculty members can identify relevant materials, adopt them for the classroom and get the necessary links to embed the materials in a syllabus and/or their course management system.  Pretty dope. Here is a look.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nReflections on Synchronicity and Week 3 DigPINS Sync Activities\nNext Post\nBut I thought geography was just about maps?!\n(2) Comments\nReid Riggle\nJuly 13, 2018 at 5:17 pm\nReply\nGreat post, Mitchell.  You nicely articulated the key role libraries are playing in the OER movement.  Our establishment of SNC’s IR, Digital Commons @ St. Norbert College\nhttps://www.snc.edu/library/digitalcommons.html\nwas intended, in part, to help us do this kind of work at St. Norbert.  We are just getting started, connecting with faculty about the opportunities is a key element as we move forward.    Your post can help facilitate this process.\nSarah\nJuly 17, 2018 at 7:56 pm\nReply\nI have a passing familiarity with SNC’s Digital Commons because they were discussed in a grant we submitted last year.

I’m exhausted just thinking about it and it makes me quite comfortable in my current state of digital idleness.  But, breaking out of our comfort zone and trying something new is usually a good thing and maybe Stewart is right that the only path forward, with the help of DigPins, is through.\nFor myself, I can see this process playing out the same way as when I started running for exercise.  At first, a ½ mile is going to be terrible and require what seems like way too much effort for the short distance traveled. But eventually, less effort will be required (right?) and terrible might actually give way to some form of enjoyment from the process (maybe?).  That is my hope at least and at the end of this experience if no form of digital residency is appealing then I can retreat back to digital observer, visitor and consumer.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nPublish What?\nNext Post\nEmbracing the Digital Game\n(1) Comment\nautumm\nJune 27, 2018 at 2:50 am\nReply\nHey Mitchell,\nThanks for this post.

A few interesting readings, a visitor resident map, slack discussions, and finally putting off my blog post until I have had a chance to see how the crowd was positioned before I shouted my thoughts into cyberspace. In real life… sorry IRL I enjoy the quiet and I would much rather spend my time with a few friends having a drink on the back porch or in some wilderness far from civilization. When planning a vacation big cities are on the bottom of the list – I grew up a short drive from DC, Pittsburgh, and Baltimore yet visited all of them collectively less than a dozen times. I think this identity translates well to my digital identity and explains most of my online habits. Any time I begin to engage in any form of social media I almost immediately become this guy:\nMost of the internet I am a visitor. Any place I am a resident is focused on interacting with that small group of friends and family or to promote myself professionally. I seek places on the web where I can accomplish a task without much interaction with others. Just as I get overwhelmed in a city with all the noise, hustle, and bustle, I find find some digital environments to be the same so I avoid them. So now week 1 is done and it is time to get introspective. Who am I online and what does this mean for pedagogy? My digital identity is more or less a hermit, I come out now and then to be reminded about what I am missing then I retreat to my cave (credit to Mitchell Scott’s much better prairie dog analogy). I use digital tools necessary to accomplish my research or teaching. As an instructor or collaborator, I need to consider other’s digital identity to be effective in my teaching and research. I might prefer the quiet, but every now and then you need to venture into the city.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nEmbracing the Digital Game\nNext Post\nZone of proximal development\n(2) Comments\nautumm\nJune 27, 2018 at 3:01 am\nReply\nThanks for this reflection Adam. Though you describe yourself as leaning more visitor I think you have the great makings of a resident if you so desire.  One thing that drives me nuts about a lot of resident activity is that much of it can be sort of thoughtless.

When you say “thank you” to the waiter who brings you those scallops (yum!) or ask the farmer at the CSA how many more weeks of asparagus are left, that’s a little, authentic, incomplete snapshot of you in that moment in your life. So you might think about how those little moments with new acquaintances relate to new digital-first acquaintances.\nSometimes those moments become part of something bigger… I’m currently making an effort to learn the staff’s names at my local coffee shop. (This is mostly because a new staff member introduced himself and I got embarrassed that I didn’t know the rest of the staff.) And sometimes a little moment is all there is… I recently moved offices and threw out a whole bunch of business cards for people who I’m sure were perfectly nice, and I hope I was fully present with them, but I really can’t remember them now.\nOf course the big difference is that our digital interactions do leave a reviewable footprint. There are certainly a few interactions I’ve left out there which I’m not proud of anymore. (I was probably authentically proud of them at the time, but time wounds all heels.) So it is a little different than managing ephemeral interactions where we’ve only got memories to go on instead of evidence.\nSarah\nJune 26, 2018 at 11:44 pm\nThanks for that Joe! Good point about the difference between ephemeral IRL interactions and the (minor) footprint left by digital interactions. Perhaps that’s part of my hang up as well as the lack of body language which says so much more than words.\nautumm\nJune 25, 2018 at 1:59 pm\nReply\nThanks for this post Sarah. Authenticity is always something that comes up when we start talking about identity. Here is the thing…. I don’t think that even in the flesh you can really portray your in-depth authentic self all of the time to everyone. Do you worry about being your authentic self with the person at the check-out counter? If you do worry about it do you feel that the encounter even gives you enough time and tools fo expression to really flesh it out? I’m thinking no. You do the best you can with what you have in that brief encounter to bring yourself to that person. Perhaps you smile and make small talk or perhaps you need to ask to talk to a manager because of problem. Either way you do the best with what you have and with the tools and customs of the environment to bring the elements of who you are to that space.\nI hope this helps. I also hope that through DigPINS that you can find some tools that allow you to express yourself.\nLeave a Reply to\nJoe Murphy\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

It’s exciting to be able to collaborate on this platform and create a digital id! Mapping out my digital identification for digPINS made me realize that I’ve been most invested on creating a professional id, whether that is as resident or visitor. Some of the key points that stand out from my own VR-map which I’d like to comment on at this time are the following two: 1) Blogging is an entirely new experience for me. I didn’t think of creating a blog before. Perhaps one of the reasons is my own mis/understanding of the time needed to keep a blog. I knew that digPINS requires one and I’m willing (and definitely ready!) to get out of my comfort zone to explore this new component of an online id. And 2) My dig. id as a “resident-professional” has lately been working on research publications; more specifically, working on articles and in a more carefully-planned timeline has been my book-length manuscript for the past two-and-a-half years (in addition to teaching, of course). This entails keeping a very active mode of engagement in sharing my work with reviewers/editors in Google docs. In addition, this summer in particular, I’ve been fully engaged with the e.Proofing system, which is a new online editing tool for me. It’s been gratifying to have been able to edit my book using e.Proofing. I’ve been able to remotely correct my work, which makes the editing process so much faster.

It is fun to look at the larger trends and think about how we fit or don’t fit into them and I do think that the larger studies that are based on age can be of value for reflecting sociologically. I do worry, however, that too often we let these “trends” define us or define others around us.\nThe end of the PEW report that you posted on Millennials states it best\n“We look forward to spending the next few years studying this generation as it enters adulthood. All the while, we’ll keep in mind that generations are a lens through which to understand societal change, rather than a label with which to oversimplify differences between groups.”\nThanks for this post!\nLeave a Reply to\nautumm\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\nWrite a Comment...\nEmail (Required)\nName (Required)\nWebsite\nLoading Comments...\nComment\n×\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

I used Facebook particularly to connect with friends, family and\nacquaintances, but I was going to be on the job market and realized it could\naffect my professional career. As a result, I started deleting all my posts and\nthen decided I had to delete my accounts. A year later, I opened new social\nmedia accounts and was very strategic in the ways I used them. I found it was a\ndifferent experience, I had less friends and a lot more professional networks\nbut also more work. It became common for students to ask for letters of\nrecommendation via social platforms or for students to comment on my teaching.\nThese apps felt a lot like my Soots or my professional e-mails, so again I\ndecided to change how I was using these apps.\nI currently use Facebook, Messenger, Twitter, Slack, Skypeand Google specifically for academic purposes. In these social platforms, I mainly interact with academics, writers, professors, graduate students, researchers, and colleagues. I am happy with my current online interaction, although at times I feel I’ve had to sacrifice personal and social relationships with the people I know. For me, it was either a professional identity or a personal one, having multiple audiences was a challenge I was not ready to undertake. Perhaps, as I grow in my professional career I can change the ways I interact online. This goes back to a question Cristina made in her earlier blog, “how important will [my digital identity] be when I go up for tenure?” This is a tricky question, having a digital identity may affect our professional career but also not having one can have the same effect. It almost becomes suspicious for a person not to have a digital identity or be a critical online citizen. It is as if our online presence is a form of ID and not having one can implicate a lack of existence, credibility or citizenship.\nImage CCO Author Andres Chapparro from Pexels\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\n2\nbloggers\nlike this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nMy Current Networks and What I Want to Develop in a PLN.\nNext Post\nUncharted Territory\n(5) Comments\nCristina\nJanuary 16, 2019 at 5:11 pm\nReply\nI still think about this, Judy.

At the time, I thought it was callous and overly formal, but I’ve come around to see the wisdom in being careful with your “indelible” words. As someone who is quick to speak and favors the irreverent and flippant, writing and anticipating an audience is a helpful check. What works in speech, especially face-to-face, doesn’t always translate in writing. [Interesting side note: the college friend went on to become a writer and has just published her first novel,\nAlternative Remedies for Loss\n.]\nSarah wrote earlier today\nabout the challenge of representing oneself clearly and authentically, especially with those whom we lack the foundation of face-to-face time, what she called “bigger context of who [we are].” I’m thinking about a version of that challenge as I head into teaching my first online course: how to build authentic and meaningful relationships digitally without being able to “read the room” in the way I can with a traditional class. My goal in public writing is a voice that is engaging and authentic, but I’m wondering already if positioning writing as the primary means of meeting and getting to know one another is too limited and static.\nAutumm and Joe have set a good tone\nand inspired me with the mix of synchronous and asynchronous interactions for DigPINs.

Now that I write that, perhaps the answer is to ask students to check in and show progress.\nAnyway, thank you\nLeave a Reply to\nKatie Ries\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

I used Facebook particularly to connect with friends, family and\nacquaintances, but I was going to be on the job market and realized it could\naffect my professional career. As a result, I started deleting all my posts and\nthen decided I had to delete my accounts. A year later, I opened new social\nmedia accounts and was very strategic in the ways I used them. I found it was a\ndifferent experience, I had less friends and a lot more professional networks\nbut also more work. It became common for students to ask for letters of\nrecommendation via social platforms or for students to comment on my teaching.\nThese apps felt a lot like my Soots or my professional e-mails, so again I\ndecided to change how I was using these apps.\nI currently use Facebook, Messenger, Twitter, Slack, Skypeand Google specifically for academic purposes. In these social platforms, I mainly interact with academics, writers, professors, graduate students, researchers, and colleagues. I am happy with my current online interaction, although at times I feel I’ve had to sacrifice personal and social relationships with the people I know. For me, it was either a professional identity or a personal one, having multiple audiences was a challenge I was not ready to undertake. Perhaps, as I grow in my professional career I can change the ways I interact online. This goes back to a question Cristina made in her earlier blog, “how important will [my digital identity] be when I go up for tenure?” This is a tricky question, having a digital identity may affect our professional career but also not having one can have the same effect. It almost becomes suspicious for a person not to have a digital identity or be a critical online citizen. It is as if our online presence is a form of ID and not having one can implicate a lack of existence, credibility or citizenship.\nImage CCO Author Andres Chapparro from Pexels\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\n2\nbloggers\nlike this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nMy Current Networks and What I Want to Develop in a PLN.\nNext Post\nUncharted Territory\n(5) Comments\nCristina\nJanuary 16, 2019 at 5:11 pm\nReply\nI still think about this, Judy.

I talk to children and adults who have been incarcerated for a long time and are released into the middle of this.

I started to care about social media and also my life online about my junior year of high school. Growing up, I lived in the country and had basically no internet, I didn’t have a phone until 13 and I didn’t have a smartphone until sophomore year. Sure, I grew up with technology more than my parents, but it didn’t really control my life like some children today.\nIn my life, I feel like each major social media I use has a different and distinct purpose. The main ones I use are Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, and Facebook. I scroll through Instagram the most because I enjoy pictures the most. However, sometimes it can be hard to realize that everyone only puts the best parts of their lives online, and it’s not an accurate representation of their life. My main use of Snapchat is to message people and groups. Facebook is mainly used if I want to connect to my family because they are the majority of my “friends” on Facebook.\nThe social media platform I use in what I would call the weirdest way is Twitter. I don’t think I have ever actually tweeted anything, I only like things and scroll through my feed. For me, Twitter tends to be the most real platform. I have found that the majority of people on Twitter actually share their life stories and the bad parts of their life alongside the good parts, instead of only the perfect aspects.\nThe easiest and hardest site for me to post on is my own blog. I have a decently normal and boring life compared to many others. I always feel like there has to be an exciting event or reason for me to post on my blog and that past few months my life has been very boring and bland. The other difference with my blog is I never know who will read the posts. I share the posts through my Facebook, so most of the people reading them are my family, but it is out on the internet for anyone to see. Writing for such a broad audience is definitely the hardest part about having a blog.\nOver the past couple of years, I have also realized how ridiculously careful I have to be online because of what I post, but especially because of the posts of others. I have heard many stories of those whose careers and lives have been basically ruined because of one picture or post online. Scrolling through social media on the weekends, I see so many posts of people at parties and drinking and I can’t imagine if something would happen if I was in that position. I have worked so hard for my education my entire life and I don’t know what I would ever do if that was all thrown away.\nOne of the activities this week for the Digital Identity week was to create a Visitor and Resident map of the different social media I use. Here is my Visitor and Resident Map\nMy Visitor and Resident Map\nHere is the explanation of each of the social media and technologies I have listed (from left to right):\nSearching- I almost always know what I am looking for when I google search something and rarely ever go to the second page of results\nEmail- I only send emails to individuals or very small groups of people. I mainly use email for school, some personal emails\nSnapchat- I mainly use Snapchat to message individuals or small groups of people. I very rarely post on my story for all of my friends to see\nGoogle drive- Mostly I use google drive for school, mainly writing papers. If anything is shared it is usually in a group of very few or for a class presentation\nFacebook- I am mainly Facebook friends with friends and family, however a lot of pictures you can see by just searching my profile and not even being my friend\nTwitter- Twitter was the hardest box to place. I really only go on twitter to look at what other people post and never really post anything of my own ideas\nInstagram- Instagram is one of the most social platforms that I use and up until college my entire profile was public for anyone to see and react to my posts\nTexting- Texting for me is very much targeted social activity and very personal activity.\nMy Domain- This platform is the most social of all of the others I use. When you google my name, it is one of the very first items that appear\nOverall, I have realized over the past year or so how addicting social media can be. About six months ago, I took a weekend break from (most) social media and I found it to be incredibly freeing. However, I have realized that I am so connected to my phone and social media and it is incredibly hard to give it up for even a few hours. I hope that I can give up social media for a bit because it has also taught me how toxic social media can be, especially Instagram due to the comparison of how one person’s life compared to mine.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nSocial Technologies\nNext Post\nDays Late, Dollars Short\n(2) Comments\nCristina\nJanuary 11, 2019 at 4:34 pm\nReply\nThanks for sharing this, Cassie. It is refreshing to see how much thought you put into your digital identity. It leads me to wonder if you are the exception or the rule? Do you think most people your age care about what they post online, or are they willing to deal with the consequences at a later point in time???\nCassie\nJanuary 11, 2019 at 4:43 pm\nI don’t think many people my age think of consequences a few years down the road. I really hope that more people did think of the consequences but many people don’t think of the effects of one post on social media.\nLeave a Reply to\nCristina\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\nWrite a Comment...\nEmail (Required)\nName (Required)\nWebsite\nLoading Comments...\nComment\n×\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

At the time, I thought it was callous and overly formal, but I’ve come around to see the wisdom in being careful with your “indelible” words. As someone who is quick to speak and favors the irreverent and flippant, writing and anticipating an audience is a helpful check. What works in speech, especially face-to-face, doesn’t always translate in writing. [Interesting side note: the college friend went on to become a writer and has just published her first novel,\nAlternative Remedies for Loss\n.]\nSarah wrote earlier today\nabout the challenge of representing oneself clearly and authentically, especially with those whom we lack the foundation of face-to-face time, what she called “bigger context of who [we are].” I’m thinking about a version of that challenge as I head into teaching my first online course: how to build authentic and meaningful relationships digitally without being able to “read the room” in the way I can with a traditional class. My goal in public writing is a voice that is engaging and authentic, but I’m wondering already if positioning writing as the primary means of meeting and getting to know one another is too limited and static.\nAutumm and Joe have set a good tone\nand inspired me with the mix of synchronous and asynchronous interactions for DigPINs. I’m looking forward to taking notes and learning from you all. Also, if you have any specific pointers for building community online, please send them my way.\n//\nImage is “Dec. 22, 2015″ by artist Fred Tomaselli.

Online courses can be really effective for pushing content and testing that content but when you want to start humanizing your online course it is a whole other thing.\nI found this EDUCAUSE Review article to be pretty helpful. The author went through the same humanizing online instruction workshop that I did a few years ago\nhttps://er.educause.edu/blogs/2017/3/humanizing-online-teaching-and-learning-the-quest-for-authenticity\nKatie Ries\nJune 26, 2018 at 2:40 pm\nThis is great, Autumm! Thanks for passing it on. One of my specific concerns is that this is an illustration course.. Were I teaching it in the studio, we’d have a lot of demos and in-class work days. It is a 300-level course, so I think it’s ok to expect students to work more outside of class, but I’m nervous about losing those points of contact mid-way. Now that I write that, perhaps the answer is to ask students to check in and show progress.\nAnyway, thank you!\nKatie Ries\nJune 26, 2018 at 2:42 pm\nReply\nThis is great, Autumm!

When you say “thank you” to the waiter who brings you those scallops (yum!) or ask the farmer at the CSA how many more weeks of asparagus are left, that’s a little, authentic, incomplete snapshot of you in that moment in your life. So you might think about how those little moments with new acquaintances relate to new digital-first acquaintances.\nSometimes those moments become part of something bigger… I’m currently making an effort to learn the staff’s names at my local coffee shop. (This is mostly because a new staff member introduced himself and I got embarrassed that I didn’t know the rest of the staff.) And sometimes a little moment is all there is… I recently moved offices and threw out a whole bunch of business cards for people who I’m sure were perfectly nice, and I hope I was fully present with them, but I really can’t remember them now.\nOf course the big difference is that our digital interactions do leave a reviewable footprint. There are certainly a few interactions I’ve left out there which I’m not proud of anymore. (I was probably authentically proud of them at the time, but time wounds all heels.) So it is a little different than managing ephemeral interactions where we’ve only got memories to go on instead of evidence.\nSarah\nJune 26, 2018 at 11:44 pm\nThanks for that Joe! Good point about the difference between ephemeral IRL interactions and the (minor) footprint left by digital interactions. Perhaps that’s part of my hang up as well as the lack of body language which says so much more than words.\nautumm\nJune 25, 2018 at 1:59 pm\nReply\nThanks for this post Sarah. Authenticity is always something that comes up when we start talking about identity. Here is the thing…. I don’t think that even in the flesh you can really portray your in-depth authentic self all of the time to everyone. Do you worry about being your authentic self with the person at the check-out counter? If you do worry about it do you feel that the encounter even gives you enough time and tools fo expression to really flesh it out? I’m thinking no. You do the best you can with what you have in that brief encounter to bring yourself to that person. Perhaps you smile and make small talk or perhaps you need to ask to talk to a manager because of problem. Either way you do the best with what you have and with the tools and customs of the environment to bring the elements of who you are to that space.\nI hope this helps. I also hope that through DigPINS that you can find some tools that allow you to express yourself.\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

It’s not just the technology or the apps that are new, it’s the accumulation of years of subtle changes in how we communicate that leaves them feeling like they’ve been released into a completely different world.\nLeave a Reply to\nCristina\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\nWrite a Comment...\nEmail (Required)\nName (Required)\nWebsite\nLoading Comments...\nComment\n×\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

When you say “thank you” to the waiter who brings you those scallops (yum!) or ask the farmer at the CSA how many more weeks of asparagus are left, that’s a little, authentic, incomplete snapshot of you in that moment in your life. So you might think about how those little moments with new acquaintances relate to new digital-first acquaintances.\nSometimes those moments become part of something bigger… I’m currently making an effort to learn the staff’s names at my local coffee shop. (This is mostly because a new staff member introduced himself and I got embarrassed that I didn’t know the rest of the staff.) And sometimes a little moment is all there is… I recently moved offices and threw out a whole bunch of business cards for people who I’m sure were perfectly nice, and I hope I was fully present with them, but I really can’t remember them now.\nOf course the big difference is that our digital interactions do leave a reviewable footprint. There are certainly a few interactions I’ve left out there which I’m not proud of anymore. (I was probably authentically proud of them at the time, but time wounds all heels.) So it is a little different than managing ephemeral interactions where we’ve only got memories to go on instead of evidence.\nSarah\nJune 26, 2018 at 11:44 pm\nThanks for that Joe! Good point about the difference between ephemeral IRL interactions and the (minor) footprint left by digital interactions. Perhaps that’s part of my hang up as well as the lack of body language which says so much more than words.\nautumm\nJune 25, 2018 at 1:59 pm\nReply\nThanks for this post Sarah. Authenticity is always something that comes up when we start talking about identity. Here is the thing…. I don’t think that even in the flesh you can really portray your in-depth authentic self all of the time to everyone. Do you worry about being your authentic self with the person at the check-out counter? If you do worry about it do you feel that the encounter even gives you enough time and tools fo expression to really flesh it out? I’m thinking no. You do the best you can with what you have in that brief encounter to bring yourself to that person. Perhaps you smile and make small talk or perhaps you need to ask to talk to a manager because of problem. Either way you do the best with what you have and with the tools and customs of the environment to bring the elements of who you are to that space.\nI hope this helps. I also hope that through DigPINS that you can find some tools that allow you to express yourself.\nLeave a Reply to\nautumm\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

Here is the link if you want to play:\nhttps://ncase.me/crowds/\nSlack, Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp: My main online networks\nIn looking at who I interact with online and how I interact with them, I see that much depends on the platform that I am using. As I mentioned last week, I use Twitter mainly for staying abreast of information in my field and connecting with other scholars, while Facebook has become a sort of catch-all for the many people that I’ve come into contact with over the years; it is mostly friends, family, and former students, although there are a few academic acquaintances that have been in my network for awhile now.\nI don’t post often in Facebook, and in fact, I rarely use Facebook to interact “publicly” with those closest to me. For these individuals, I tend to use iMessage and WhatsApp, with the latter being the platform that I use to communicate with my closest friends. When I think about it, WhatsApp is what has helped my group of friends to remain close now that we all live in different cities. In fact, our daily group chats make it so that we can pick up wherever we last left off when we talk on the phone or see each other in person.\nUnlike Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp, in Slack I interact with a community of writers and researchers, whose real names and faces I will never know. Taking part in a group like this would have sounded odd to me a few years ago, but their company, solidarity and words of encouragement helped me through the lonely task of writing a dissertation.\nNew directions and reflections on developing my personal learning network.\nWithin the last year or so, I have started using Facebook for more professional purposes. I now follow quite a few academic groups and departments to find out what the conversations in my field are and what other departments of languages, literatures, and culture are talking about. Nevertheless, I don’t post on their wall or share their posts on mine. This is mostly because I am aware of my audience on Facebook, and no one in my family is going to want to know more about the Spanish Film Series going on at the University of Kansas, for example. I know that I want to develop my personal learning network (PLN) more, and that is one of the reasons that I joined DigPINS, but I also know that I probably won’t be doing so through Facebook, as Twitter seems to be the better venue for this.\nThe readings this week have definitely made me think more about how I want to continue to curate my Twitter network, and I found the Nicky Case narrative game to be an informative (and fun!) way of helping me to visualize the way that networks work. I already follow a diverse group of academics on Twitter that specialize in a variety of fields that interest me, and I have found that doing so is helpful for learning about conferences, articles, and new books that have just come out. In addition, many also post teaching and writing resources that are useful for what I do. In the future, I would like to share more professional resources on Twitter and engage in conversations with other academics.\nAs I wrap up my reflections for this week, something that I’ve been wondering is how others deal with information overload. (Again, I’m thinking about the social media detox!) Does anyone have any strategies on managing this? Sometimes when I go on Twitter, I see so many interesting posts, articles, books, and comments, that in the end it just feels overwhelming. I want to cast a wide enough net where I see a variety of posts and conversations, but at times it just feels like I am being pulled in too many directions at once. Also, piggybacking on some of the sentiments in the article “How Millennials Became the Burnout Generation,” as my social media networks have begun to gravitate towards topics related to my field, I wonder if I have internalized the idea that I should be working all the time–including on social media.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nTo interact, or not to interact…. that is the question!\nNext Post\nCritical Citizen\n(4) Comments\nParisa\nJanuary 16, 2019 at 6:59 pm\nReply\nHi Katie!

Twitter can be overwhelming and I can seem to scroll through my feed sometimes for hours and it can be an unproductive use of my time. Last night for the first time I used the downtime feature on my iPhone to essentially lock my phone after midnight and force me to go to bed. They also have app limits on how much time a day you can spend on an app. I know these features are meant for kids, but it is helping me to see how much time a day I am spending on social media and each specific app.\nKatie G\nJanuary 17, 2019 at 12:42 am\nThanks for the comment, Cassie!\nI am always overjoyed when my phone tells me that my screen time was less than last week.\nAs for the apps that you mentioned, I applaud you for using them!

At this conference, I attended Katina Rogers’ panel “Going Public: How and Why to Develop a Digital Scholarly Identity,” during which she stated that regardless of whether you want to be found online or not, these days it is incredibly difficult to hide from the Internet and the powers of Google. She continued by emphasizing that the traces of you that show up online are inevitably what others will use to form a first impression of you. Thus, she advocates for taking control of your image (instead of letting Google do it for you) and managing your own digital identity by (1) cultivating the content that you want associated with your name and (2) by “going public” with it.\nKatina Rogers’ talk at the MLA also echoed many of the same points made by Laura Pasquini in her piece “Why Academics need a Digital Persona,” particularly her observations regarding the use of digital technology to participate in conversations with colleagues in your field, or as Pasquini states, in order to “connect, learn and engage in the profession.” In fact, I have a Twitter account for this very reason, and I have found it incredibly helpful for not only discovering information and resources pertinent to my field, but also for staying abreast of what the most prominent voices are saying about academic topics that interest me.\nWhile I enjoyed reading Pasquini’s article, I agree with what Cristina wrote in her blog post, since I also do not view our online self as corresponding completely to our real, off-line self. Indeed, I believe that it is much more complicated than that. As Cristina pointed out, online identities can not only be censured and constructed to portray a certain image, but also, when we are speaking about one’s identity, there are inevitably many, many layers to who we are. My Twitter account, for instance, only provides one small window into who I am, or at least into how I present myself on that platform. And in regards to online platforms, my Twitter account and my Facebook account are not linked. I use them for completely different purposes that sometimes overlap, but for the most part are different windows into my life, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that they represent different\nfragments of my digital self\n. To add to this, there are elements of my off-line self that I share only with those that are dearest to me–those that have been with me for the long haul and are my most trusted confidants. But I’m going off on a tangent here… let me get back to the articles and the matter at hand…\nI found Bonnie Stewart’s piece to be thought provoking as well, and her reflection on one’s audience and who you are writing for is particularly useful when thinking about “going public” with your digital persona. I would, however, like to add to her comments concerning academics that are cautious regarding what is posted from their research, specifically during conference presentations. I believe that such hesitations are generally linked to questions involving ethics, power structures, and vulnerability, especially with those who are newer to the profession. At the MLA, in fact, some scholars stressed discretion in tweeting about unpublished research presented by junior faculty members, contingent faculty/staff, and students. It wasn’t that those at the conference were resisting this digital platform, it was that they were conscious of the vulnerability of those with less power and/or experience, and who are at more risk of getting their ideas scooped. While at the conference, I attended a fascinating presentation on a digital humanities project during which the junior scholar that was presenting asked the audience to refrain from posting photos of her project online since it is not yet finished. I find this to be completely understandable and believe that we must use technology in an ethical way that is not only respectful of others and of their work, but that in addition, does not take advantage of the most vulnerable among us.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nOur various selves\nNext Post\nVR Map\n(2) Comments\nAvery\nJanuary 9, 2019 at 10:15 pm\nReply\nHello Katie, I would have loved to attend the session you describe ““Going Public: How and Why to Develop a Digital Scholarly Identity.” It is true that whether or not we like it there are traces of all of us on the internet. Has anyone you’ve met professionally ever based their first impressions of you off of your digital identity? That is something I have thought about, has anyone ever googled me and used that information.\nKatie G\nJanuary 10, 2019 at 3:34 am\nHi, Avery! I don´t know if anyone has actually admitted that to me, but I confess that before I go to a conference, I tend to look up the speakers that interest me to see what topics they typically research and if we have any points in common. Without fail, certain websites related to teaching (and which shall not be named here!) show up with ratings of the individual´s courses. This is just one example how information online could contribute to the opinions that we form about others before we get to know them.\nAs a side note, at another panel related to technology at the MLA, they had audience members pair up and google each other to see how their searches were different. That would be a fascinating activity to do together in person!\nLeave a Reply to\nAvery\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

As a facilitator of the community I can’t promise I’ll have the bandwidth to blog with everyone for every week but digital identity is something that I’m fascinated by and my thinking has been stimulated by all of our conversations and I was inspired to jump in.\nSelves and Spaces\nDigital identity is an interesting topic to me because it falls in this intersection of who a person is and what impact their environment has on the way they present themselves and how those two realms interact with one another. This is also why I appreciate how the identity week and the networks week in #DigPINS sort of feed into one another.\nWe like to think that we get to make the choice about who we are and while I think that we have a lot control over defining ourselves I can’t shake how much we are defined by our environments, the roles that we hold, and those that we are surrounded by.\nWe like to think that we have the luxury of precisely and specifically defining ourselves for the world but that is never the case. This becomes particularly problematic in thinking about digital identity because there is a plethora of rhetoric both condemning and advocating for presentation of self online that just muddies the waters.\nOne side of this paradigm promotes presentation of self, in excess, in as many platforms as possible, toward a complete representation of an authentic self, and holds up this idea as a way to become more in tune with who you are through the connecting with others. This is flawed of course but no better is the other side which sees digital connecting as narcissism and navel gazing at best and demonizes any kind of presentation of self online.\nActive listening\nIn 1956, Donald Horton and R. Richard Whol published “\nMass communication and para-social interaction: Observations on intimacy at a distance\n” in the journal Psychiatry. Here, they brought in a new concept and term – the parasocial interaction. They observed that there was a one-sided social interaction that spectators could experience with television characters that could begin to feel like a personal relationship to some. If you have ever had a crush on a celebrity or hoped that your favorite TV character might fall in love with another character, you have had a parasocial interaction.\nParasocial interactions most often are healthy and normal and can even aid in self-development.\nBut for me this begs to ask a question about digital identity. Horton and Whol were looking at connections that spectators were making with people on television but in our modern times so many have the opportunity to create environments where they can be watched and where they try to build an audience. So many who are not professional actors or journalists. I’m sure there is more literature about how spectators of online content creators have parasocial interactions. I need to look into this more but I’m curious how this bleeds together when the content creators are connecting with each other.\nOur identities are not just shaped by the digital creations we put out but by how they are received by those who read, view, and consume what we create. I’d like to suggest that as humans we are bigger than what we create. Be we celebrity or low-level education blogger we can’t control every aspect of how our creations will be received. They cannot represent the whole of who we are and yet it seems there persists an expectation that they should. Is this because we are used to parasocial connections that are made with those who are professionals in making content? Are we comparing our digital representations of self to those that have whole production teams behind them?\nReal and Authentic Selves\nI have a complicated relationship with the way we use the word “real” in online spaces. In terms of digital identity the word “authenticity” is another that gives me pause. It seems that those two narratives that I mentioned before – those two extremes: utopian presentation of self in excess and the other that shuns digital representation – both of these paradigms love to use these words. Both ascribe to the idea that “real” and “authentic” are things that could be simple. Simple as excess of content or lack of content in favor of physicality.\nIt rings more true for me that our “real” selves are much more complex than we want to admit and that our audiences, friends, and yes even families know us in contexts and environments that align to different presentations of self. That I don’t behave the same way with my family that I would in a job interview or in this blog post is normal and healthy. I think that expectations that we be all things in all contexts are misplaced.\nI recognize that this is dangerous territory,  and I should be clear that I’m not advocating for any of this at a lack of personal integrity. I am advocating for sincerity over authenticity and finding a way to celebrate digital contextualization that is not based in celebrity but in something closer to every-day experiences. It seems that if we can do that anywhere that it would be in learning spaces.\nI’m excited to start week 2 around networks and I’m really grateful that #DigPINS gives us all an opportunity to discuss these concepts.\nThis post is cross posted on my personal blog at\nhttp://autumm.edtech.fm/2019/01/14/digital-identities-and-real-selves/\nImage CC0 Author Foundry from Pixabay\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nDays Late, Dollars Short\nNext Post\nDigital Identity and Media Consumption\n(1) Comment\nDigital Identities and “Real” Selves – Is a Liminal Space\nJanuary 14, 2019 at 7:02 am\nReply\n[…] This post is cross listed as part of the January 2019 #DigPINS cohort that I helped to facilitate at https://snc.digpins.org/uncategorized/digital-identities-and-real-selves/ […]\nLeave a Reply to\nDigital Identities and “Real” Selves – Is a Liminal Space\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

I am in awe of those individuals who words seem to effortlessly flow out of into coherent, cohesive, and even captivating posts, articles, blogs, etc.\nWho am I online?\nI googled myself this Monday to see what I would find. The answer is, not much! I have never had a Twitter account and only briefly had Snap-chat, Instagram, and Facebook accounts. The only other “traces” I found was an old wedding registry (oops) and a professional contact page that UW-Green Bay has yet to remove. I currently to do not have much in the way of a “digital identity.”\nWho would do I want to be? How would I like to curate my digital identity?\nIn an alternate reality, I think I would be active online on a blog or through Instagram or some other digital venue. I would be unfiltered, punchy, and awesome! But like I said….in an ALTERNATE reality. In this reality, when one slight misstep can follow you forever I cannot imagine being so free.\nWhen I think about who I am – my irrational aversion to large swaths of technology and “the man” – I think that my digital identity is a very reserved and carefully curated one. It has taken me three days to write this much. Even now I am thinking, am I being to informal? What do I have to offer that is worth writing down? Will I be criticized by a colleague? Will everyone else be better than me?\nI am usually absurdly confident but the internet, social media, technology  bring out this unabated apprehension. I am hopeful that #DigPINS will allow me to dip my toes in the water of crafting a digital identity and that my fellow cohort members will challenge me in new ways!\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nVR Map\nNext Post\nUnhappy Digital Citizens\n(2) Comments\nKatie G\nJanuary 10, 2019 at 3:22 am\nReply\nHi, Avery! I scrutinize every word and every thought before I put it “out there,” too! So, I understand just how paralyzing that can be. I also think that it is safe to assume that much like Planet Fitness Gyms, you you are in a judgement free zone.\nYou might have the opposite problem that I have in that, I just googled you and your name is fairly common. I got all kinds of hits, but many of them were other people with the same name. This affords you with a certain amount of anonymity, but it would make me nervous because I would not want other people to confuse me with someone else with the same name!\nI´m glad that you are on this journey and it will be fun to see how this digital initiative will challenge us to reflect and grow in regards to our digital selves.\nC-C\nJanuary 16, 2019 at 1:41 am\nReply\nHi, Avery!

I feel like an intrepid explorer with my mouse and my keypad browsing through the good, the bad, the interesting, and the unabashedly ugly.\nConnecting\nThis exploration into uncharted territories has sparked many conversations with friends, coworkers, and my supervisor about social media, networking, digital identity, etc. One conversation in particular, served as a great precursor to Katia Hildebrandt’s writing, “(Digital) Identity in a World that No Longer Forgets.” We were talking about mistakes, forgiveness, the ability to grow as an individual, and how the internet/its audience seems to only focus on one of these: mistakes. When we look at this week’s theme, networks, along with the idea of making mistakes online – how might that impact resonate on and off-line? Will our networks, our audience grant forgiveness and give room for us to grow as individuals or will they partake in “cybervigilantism?”\nHildebrandt perfectly described my own worry that, “our every digital act might someday be scrutinized by someone, somewhere, the scope of what we can ‘safely’ discuss online is incredibly narrow and limited to the mainstream and inoffensive.” I do not believe that most companies, especially social media platforms, are naturally ethically or morally responsible. They will not, without pressure or demand, construct or facilitate environments that foster compassion and grace.\nAside from my newly formed Twitter account and an old LindedIn profile, I do not formally interact in many online networks. #DigPINS has thrown me into more forums at once than I think I have ever had. It has been interesting.\nQuestioning\nEntering this learning community, I expected that I would learn more about the value of having an online presence and curating a digital identity (which I believe I have) but I also expected that participating would kick off my desire to be more connected/digitally “present.” I cannot say it has done the latter. If anything, I am questioning the value in working to curate a digital identity beyond this project. I think it can be immensely valuable for many professionals. However, I do not know what I as an individual need a large online presence. On the other hand, the opportunity for an office or department presence is still worth considering.\nDespite my questioning, I am savoring the conversations sparked in and out of #DigPINS, and deeply appreciate the work everyone in this learning community has put into creating this experience.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nCritical Citizen\nNext Post\nUni Dilly Dilly\n(2) Comments\nKatie G\nJanuary 17, 2019 at 1:00 am\nReply\nThank you for your post, Avery!\nI have had a similar reaction in our first two weeks of DigPINS.

DigPINS is not about advocating for social media or technology or digital identities for individuals. As a learning community we are not trying to hit outcomes so much as critically discuss topics and let folks draw the personal conclusions that work for them. Though you are not getting the experience that you’d expected it does sound like your thoughts on these matters are growing so I do hope that is valuable for you.\nI hope that you take some time to look at the suggested folks to network with for this week. Many of them take a very critical look at digital technology and social media on their blogs and on twitter. The paradox is of course that they do this through digital identity and networks. They contribute to a larger conversation that is pushing back against those techno-utopian narratives that I think also bother you. These voices are so important when that silicon valley rhetoric (tech is wonderful, you need your personal brand, connect as much as possible, share as much as possible, etc.) is pervasive and backed by lots of money. We need more voices like yours.\nLeave a Reply to\nKatie G\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\nWrite a Comment...\nEmail (Required)\nName (Required)\nWebsite\nLoading Comments...\nComment\n×\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

I feel like an intrepid explorer with my mouse and my keypad browsing through the good, the bad, the interesting, and the unabashedly ugly.\nConnecting\nThis exploration into uncharted territories has sparked many conversations with friends, coworkers, and my supervisor about social media, networking, digital identity, etc. One conversation in particular, served as a great precursor to Katia Hildebrandt’s writing, “(Digital) Identity in a World that No Longer Forgets.” We were talking about mistakes, forgiveness, the ability to grow as an individual, and how the internet/its audience seems to only focus on one of these: mistakes. When we look at this week’s theme, networks, along with the idea of making mistakes online – how might that impact resonate on and off-line? Will our networks, our audience grant forgiveness and give room for us to grow as individuals or will they partake in “cybervigilantism?”\nHildebrandt perfectly described my own worry that, “our every digital act might someday be scrutinized by someone, somewhere, the scope of what we can ‘safely’ discuss online is incredibly narrow and limited to the mainstream and inoffensive.” I do not believe that most companies, especially social media platforms, are naturally ethically or morally responsible. They will not, without pressure or demand, construct or facilitate environments that foster compassion and grace.\nAside from my newly formed Twitter account and an old LindedIn profile, I do not formally interact in many online networks. #DigPINS has thrown me into more forums at once than I think I have ever had. It has been interesting.\nQuestioning\nEntering this learning community, I expected that I would learn more about the value of having an online presence and curating a digital identity (which I believe I have) but I also expected that participating would kick off my desire to be more connected/digitally “present.” I cannot say it has done the latter. If anything, I am questioning the value in working to curate a digital identity beyond this project. I think it can be immensely valuable for many professionals. However, I do not know what I as an individual need a large online presence. On the other hand, the opportunity for an office or department presence is still worth considering.\nDespite my questioning, I am savoring the conversations sparked in and out of #DigPINS, and deeply appreciate the work everyone in this learning community has put into creating this experience.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nCritical Citizen\nNext Post\nUni Dilly Dilly\n(2) Comments\nKatie G\nJanuary 17, 2019 at 1:00 am\nReply\nThank you for your post, Avery!\nI have had a similar reaction in our first two weeks of DigPINS.

DigPINS is not about advocating for social media or technology or digital identities for individuals. As a learning community we are not trying to hit outcomes so much as critically discuss topics and let folks draw the personal conclusions that work for them. Though you are not getting the experience that you’d expected it does sound like your thoughts on these matters are growing so I do hope that is valuable for you.\nI hope that you take some time to look at the suggested folks to network with for this week. Many of them take a very critical look at digital technology and social media on their blogs and on twitter. The paradox is of course that they do this through digital identity and networks. They contribute to a larger conversation that is pushing back against those techno-utopian narratives that I think also bother you. These voices are so important when that silicon valley rhetoric (tech is wonderful, you need your personal brand, connect as much as possible, share as much as possible, etc.) is pervasive and backed by lots of money. We need more voices like yours.\nLeave a Reply to\nautumm\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\nWrite a Comment...\nEmail (Required)\nName (Required)\nWebsite\nLoading Comments...\nComment\n×\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

Here is the link if you want to play:\nhttps://ncase.me/crowds/\nSlack, Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp: My main online networks\nIn looking at who I interact with online and how I interact with them, I see that much depends on the platform that I am using. As I mentioned last week, I use Twitter mainly for staying abreast of information in my field and connecting with other scholars, while Facebook has become a sort of catch-all for the many people that I’ve come into contact with over the years; it is mostly friends, family, and former students, although there are a few academic acquaintances that have been in my network for awhile now.\nI don’t post often in Facebook, and in fact, I rarely use Facebook to interact “publicly” with those closest to me. For these individuals, I tend to use iMessage and WhatsApp, with the latter being the platform that I use to communicate with my closest friends. When I think about it, WhatsApp is what has helped my group of friends to remain close now that we all live in different cities. In fact, our daily group chats make it so that we can pick up wherever we last left off when we talk on the phone or see each other in person.\nUnlike Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp, in Slack I interact with a community of writers and researchers, whose real names and faces I will never know. Taking part in a group like this would have sounded odd to me a few years ago, but their company, solidarity and words of encouragement helped me through the lonely task of writing a dissertation.\nNew directions and reflections on developing my personal learning network.\nWithin the last year or so, I have started using Facebook for more professional purposes. I now follow quite a few academic groups and departments to find out what the conversations in my field are and what other departments of languages, literatures, and culture are talking about. Nevertheless, I don’t post on their wall or share their posts on mine. This is mostly because I am aware of my audience on Facebook, and no one in my family is going to want to know more about the Spanish Film Series going on at the University of Kansas, for example. I know that I want to develop my personal learning network (PLN) more, and that is one of the reasons that I joined DigPINS, but I also know that I probably won’t be doing so through Facebook, as Twitter seems to be the better venue for this.\nThe readings this week have definitely made me think more about how I want to continue to curate my Twitter network, and I found the Nicky Case narrative game to be an informative (and fun!) way of helping me to visualize the way that networks work. I already follow a diverse group of academics on Twitter that specialize in a variety of fields that interest me, and I have found that doing so is helpful for learning about conferences, articles, and new books that have just come out. In addition, many also post teaching and writing resources that are useful for what I do. In the future, I would like to share more professional resources on Twitter and engage in conversations with other academics.\nAs I wrap up my reflections for this week, something that I’ve been wondering is how others deal with information overload. (Again, I’m thinking about the social media detox!) Does anyone have any strategies on managing this? Sometimes when I go on Twitter, I see so many interesting posts, articles, books, and comments, that in the end it just feels overwhelming. I want to cast a wide enough net where I see a variety of posts and conversations, but at times it just feels like I am being pulled in too many directions at once. Also, piggybacking on some of the sentiments in the article “How Millennials Became the Burnout Generation,” as my social media networks have begun to gravitate towards topics related to my field, I wonder if I have internalized the idea that I should be working all the time–including on social media.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nTo interact, or not to interact…. that is the question!\nNext Post\nCritical Citizen\n(4) Comments\nParisa\nJanuary 16, 2019 at 6:59 pm\nReply\nHi Katie!

Twitter can be overwhelming and I can seem to scroll through my feed sometimes for hours and it can be an unproductive use of my time. Last night for the first time I used the downtime feature on my iPhone to essentially lock my phone after midnight and force me to go to bed. They also have app limits on how much time a day you can spend on an app. I know these features are meant for kids, but it is helping me to see how much time a day I am spending on social media and each specific app.\nKatie G\nJanuary 17, 2019 at 12:42 am\nThanks for the comment, Cassie!\nI am always overjoyed when my phone tells me that my screen time was less than last week.\nAs for the apps that you mentioned, I applaud you for using them!

For our friends we are one person, another person with our parents, another person with our spouse, and so on. This week’s topic, Digital Identity, got my wheels spinning and got me thinking about who exactly we are online and how we present various selves depending on our audience. There was a rather interesting quote in the Pasquini reading that stated “as your online self is your real, off-line self”. I would argue much differently. If you look through the comments of any gossip website you’ll see various inappropriate comments from people who feel a sense of freedom and power and express themselves much differently than they would in real life. If you look on facebook or instagram you find people promoting a lifestyle, relationship, etc. that they want you to believe that they have. So it leads me to question how real are our digital identities, especially when it comes to professional digital identities. How much are we censoring, how much are we revising and editing before we hit submit on a post, how much are we being shaped by our audience and how we want them to perceive us??\nThe reading also talked about the stakes being high, addiction of social media, and how our online presence is evaluated online. I would argue that as professionals we are much more aware of how high the stakes are and how responsible we have to be with our digital identity than a teen or an individual in their early 20s. I am extremely grateful that social media didn’t really exist when I was in college — a time when students are supposed to have tons of fun and not worry about a picture being posted that can haunt you forever, especially professionally!!! I digress…\nAll this to say, I have thought a lot about my digital identity over the past five years or so. There was a time when I was very active on instagram and twitter. Then, as the article mentioned, I realized how addictive it was and how much time I was wasting and how meaningless feedback or reactions could dictate my emotions for the day. So, professionally, I struggle with having a digital identity and not falling back down the rabbit hole because it is extremely hard to separate the two….\nI also wonder, is having a digital identity really necessary? For whom? How important will it be when I go up for tenure and are those who are evaluating my tenure portfolio taking my digital identity seriously or are they scoffing at my online presence and thinking I could have spent my time doing something more productive???\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\n4\nbloggers\nlike this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\n#DigPINS January 2019\nNext Post\nVarious reflections on “going public” with your digital persona\n(4) Comments\nRuthie\nJanuary 9, 2019 at 12:44 am\nReply\nAs a current student and one who grew up with social media, I can say that I agree and disagree with your statements. First, I find that I obsess over what I post on Instagram, Facebook, or anything that I post. So I agree that we become addicted to social media, regardless of age. The only statement that I can say differently to is worrying about my digital identity. I have always been aware of what I post because I know that it’s public. I am always cautious about things that I share because I know that it’ll be out there forever. However, this is the way that it has always been for me, so I see no impact.\nI enjoyed your post!\nAutumm\nJanuary 9, 2019 at 3:10 am\nReply\nHi Cristina,\nThanks so much for this compelling post. It is really refreshing to hear you speak about some of the complexity around identity and environment. Often when talking about digital identity the word “authenticity” comes up. I find this term highly problematic for the reasons that you state. We are never presenting ourselves in a stable consistent way across all environments – that would not be human. We shift the way we present ourselves based on context – this is normal. If I were speaking with my mother I would speak differently than if I were speaking in a job interview. Yet everyone strives for the single shining authentic self that is flawless and pristine – especially online.\nBut it is here that I would say that Pasquini is making a point about a very specific context. She is not citing anonymous posts on gossip sites – she is specifically speaking about a scholarly/academic public persona (and I would argue that her points are easily transferred to other professional contexts). When working in that kind of environment, with a recognizable digital identity that is tied to scholarly outputs – well the stakes are just much higher or “real” as some like to say. I think that is her point anyway.\nYou also bring up a really important point about who has time and privilege to maintain a scholarly digital ID – it is highly problematic.\n@Clelis\nJanuary 9, 2019 at 8:54 pm\nReply\nCristina, you bring up some interesting points. The one that caught me was ‘are those who are evaluating my tenure portfolio taking my digital identity seriously.’  Whether they are or aren’t, just the fact that you have to guess who your audience is and what they want is stressful. In this time of rapidly changing norms, it’s hard to know where to direct our limited time and how to tailor our efforts. What is casual conversation and what is critical? Which comment will decide our professional identities? The stakes are high.\nThat has left me feeling overwhelmed and disengaged-no one can be all things to all people, but it feels like we’re being expected to navigate all expectations of all people at any time now or in the future.\nThe V&R mapping allowed me to visualize how I have reacted to this by trying to keep a hard line between my personal and institutional identities.\nThanks for the thought-provoking post.\nAvery\nJanuary 10, 2019 at 9:34 pm\nReply\nUgh, Cristina, you captured so much of what I’ve been feeling and thinking this week so eloquently! Thank you for this post. I do question how important having a digital identity is. I have a LinkedIn because I did think it was important to have SOMETHING but I vehemently dislike Facebook and feel mostly neutral or uninterested about most other social media platforms.\nYour first paragraph about perceptions of self and others brought back the concept of “context collapse” from our readings. I think context collapse is a large reason I feel such apprehension about posting but also this feeling of loss of control.\nThanks again!\nLeave a Reply to\nAutumm\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

HOW WOULD I LIKE TO CURATE MY DIGITAL IDENTITY?\nThis will sound ridiculous, given what I’ve just shared, but in part, because I have listed my social media accounts on my cv, I feel like I should be paying more attention, in the form of providing care and feeding for my accounts.  My hope is that this work will help me do that.\nAlso counterintuitively, I really do feel like I wish I could put some good into the digital world, “good” either because something I might share could provide a positive counterpoint to so much of the garbage that exists (primarily in comments sections, I suppose), or because sometime I think things just need to be said.  If no one else is saying them, then I’d like to be able to do so.\nAs with this post, at the end of our time together I may have proven once again beyond the shadow of a doubt that, no, I do NOT have anything the world needs, and even that would be helpful, I suppose.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nExperiences with Social Media and my Digital Idenity\nNext Post\nDigital Identities and “Real” Selves\n(2) Comments\nautumm\nJanuary 14, 2019 at 6:12 am\nReply\nI think you are too hard on yourself Corday.

I am in awe of those individuals who words seem to effortlessly flow out of into coherent, cohesive, and even captivating posts, articles, blogs, etc.\nWho am I online?\nI googled myself this Monday to see what I would find. The answer is, not much! I have never had a Twitter account and only briefly had Snap-chat, Instagram, and Facebook accounts. The only other “traces” I found was an old wedding registry (oops) and a professional contact page that UW-Green Bay has yet to remove. I currently to do not have much in the way of a “digital identity.”\nWho would do I want to be? How would I like to curate my digital identity?\nIn an alternate reality, I think I would be active online on a blog or through Instagram or some other digital venue. I would be unfiltered, punchy, and awesome! But like I said….in an ALTERNATE reality. In this reality, when one slight misstep can follow you forever I cannot imagine being so free.\nWhen I think about who I am – my irrational aversion to large swaths of technology and “the man” – I think that my digital identity is a very reserved and carefully curated one. It has taken me three days to write this much. Even now I am thinking, am I being to informal? What do I have to offer that is worth writing down? Will I be criticized by a colleague? Will everyone else be better than me?\nI am usually absurdly confident but the internet, social media, technology  bring out this unabated apprehension. I am hopeful that #DigPINS will allow me to dip my toes in the water of crafting a digital identity and that my fellow cohort members will challenge me in new ways!\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nVR Map\nNext Post\nUnhappy Digital Citizens\n(2) Comments\nKatie G\nJanuary 10, 2019 at 3:22 am\nReply\nHi, Avery!

HOW WOULD I LIKE TO CURATE MY DIGITAL IDENTITY?\nThis will sound ridiculous, given what I’ve just shared, but in part, because I have listed my social media accounts on my cv, I feel like I should be paying more attention, in the form of providing care and feeding for my accounts.  My hope is that this work will help me do that.\nAlso counterintuitively, I really do feel like I wish I could put some good into the digital world, “good” either because something I might share could provide a positive counterpoint to so much of the garbage that exists (primarily in comments sections, I suppose), or because sometime I think things just need to be said.  If no one else is saying them, then I’d like to be able to do so.\nAs with this post, at the end of our time together I may have proven once again beyond the shadow of a doubt that, no, I do NOT have anything the world needs, and even that would be helpful, I suppose.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nExperiences with Social Media and my Digital Idenity\nNext Post\nDigital Identities and “Real” Selves\n(2) Comments\nautumm\nJanuary 14, 2019 at 6:12 am\nReply\nI think you are too hard on yourself Corday. You are always so inquisitive about new approaches to tech and have great questions.\nC-C\nJanuary 16, 2019 at 2:10 am\nReply\nCorday,\nThis struck a chord with me: “…something I might share could provide a positive counterpoint to so much of the garbage that exists.” There is so much bla bla bla on the internet, and I passively read it, and silently shake my head. For whatever reason, after 30 years of this being sufficient for me, I feel more internal pressure to create content and participate actively.\nThanks for putting that feeling into words.\nLeave a Reply to\nC-C\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

For our friends we are one person, another person with our parents, another person with our spouse, and so on. This week’s topic, Digital Identity, got my wheels spinning and got me thinking about who exactly we are online and how we present various selves depending on our audience. There was a rather interesting quote in the Pasquini reading that stated “as your online self is your real, off-line self”. I would argue much differently. If you look through the comments of any gossip website you’ll see various inappropriate comments from people who feel a sense of freedom and power and express themselves much differently than they would in real life. If you look on facebook or instagram you find people promoting a lifestyle, relationship, etc. that they want you to believe that they have. So it leads me to question how real are our digital identities, especially when it comes to professional digital identities. How much are we censoring, how much are we revising and editing before we hit submit on a post, how much are we being shaped by our audience and how we want them to perceive us??\nThe reading also talked about the stakes being high, addiction of social media, and how our online presence is evaluated online. I would argue that as professionals we are much more aware of how high the stakes are and how responsible we have to be with our digital identity than a teen or an individual in their early 20s. I am extremely grateful that social media didn’t really exist when I was in college — a time when students are supposed to have tons of fun and not worry about a picture being posted that can haunt you forever, especially professionally!!! I digress…\nAll this to say, I have thought a lot about my digital identity over the past five years or so. There was a time when I was very active on instagram and twitter. Then, as the article mentioned, I realized how addictive it was and how much time I was wasting and how meaningless feedback or reactions could dictate my emotions for the day. So, professionally, I struggle with having a digital identity and not falling back down the rabbit hole because it is extremely hard to separate the two….\nI also wonder, is having a digital identity really necessary? For whom? How important will it be when I go up for tenure and are those who are evaluating my tenure portfolio taking my digital identity seriously or are they scoffing at my online presence and thinking I could have spent my time doing something more productive???\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\n4\nbloggers\nlike this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\n#DigPINS January 2019\nNext Post\nVarious reflections on “going public” with your digital persona\n(4) Comments\nRuthie\nJanuary 9, 2019 at 12:44 am\nReply\nAs a current student and one who grew up with social media, I can say that I agree and disagree with your statements.

It is really refreshing to hear you speak about some of the complexity around identity and environment. Often when talking about digital identity the word “authenticity” comes up. I find this term highly problematic for the reasons that you state. We are never presenting ourselves in a stable consistent way across all environments – that would not be human. We shift the way we present ourselves based on context – this is normal. If I were speaking with my mother I would speak differently than if I were speaking in a job interview. Yet everyone strives for the single shining authentic self that is flawless and pristine – especially online.\nBut it is here that I would say that Pasquini is making a point about a very specific context. She is not citing anonymous posts on gossip sites – she is specifically speaking about a scholarly/academic public persona (and I would argue that her points are easily transferred to other professional contexts). When working in that kind of environment, with a recognizable digital identity that is tied to scholarly outputs – well the stakes are just much higher or “real” as some like to say. I think that is her point anyway.\nYou also bring up a really important point about who has time and privilege to maintain a scholarly digital ID – it is highly problematic.\n@Clelis\nJanuary 9, 2019 at 8:54 pm\nReply\nCristina, you bring up some interesting points. The one that caught me was ‘are those who are evaluating my tenure portfolio taking my digital identity seriously.’  Whether they are or aren’t, just the fact that you have to guess who your audience is and what they want is stressful. In this time of rapidly changing norms, it’s hard to know where to direct our limited time and how to tailor our efforts. What is casual conversation and what is critical? Which comment will decide our professional identities? The stakes are high.\nThat has left me feeling overwhelmed and disengaged-no one can be all things to all people, but it feels like we’re being expected to navigate all expectations of all people at any time now or in the future.\nThe V&R mapping allowed me to visualize how I have reacted to this by trying to keep a hard line between my personal and institutional identities.\nThanks for the thought-provoking post.\nAvery\nJanuary 10, 2019 at 9:34 pm\nReply\nUgh, Cristina, you captured so much of what I’ve been feeling and thinking this week so eloquently!

I have a LinkedIn because I did think it was important to have SOMETHING but I vehemently dislike Facebook and feel mostly neutral or uninterested about most other social media platforms.\nYour first paragraph about perceptions of self and others brought back the concept of “context collapse” from our readings.

Among other things, I was to dive into Twitter and become more of a resident to develop a personal learning network. In keeping with the Ron Swanson gifs, my first thought was:\nBefore I go on, I’ll say that tweeting and exploring networks wasn’t bad. My wife says I can be a bit of a curmudgeon so I blocked out any notions I had about Twitter and dove in. I’m most interested in applying these lessons to improving my teaching and I have enjoyed having the student perspective. I think most thought-provoking was the Nicky Case narrative game The Wisdom and/or Madness of Crowds which got me thinking about what kind of “node” I am and what I should be. I signed up for Twitter, started following some people, and immediately my feed was filled with tweets and suggestions on who to follow. Though I was only following a few people, it was easy to start seeing information flowing from so many different networks of people. Social justice issues, cutting edge research, personal posts, news. and politics. Several have commented on how twitter can be overwhelming at first and I would agree. Trying to manage the flood of information and sift through the useless information to find the useful is difficult. I looked a lot at twitter profiles for professional organizations and would follow them and check out the suggested pages. My feed quickly turned into an echo-chamber with highly similar information bouncing around. I followed new people in very different areas and the feed changed. So after a week I developed a massive following… nine people, and I think all of them are in the #DigPINS group. So what information do I share? I had to consider my “audience” and what information they might care about or find useful. Clearly posting something about a highly technical article is a poor choice. An inspirational quote maybe? A selfie? I settled on re-tweeting from some of the organizations I followed – try to move information from my personal learning network into a network of people that aren’t biologists studying conservation or zoonotic diseases. Perhaps I could use my role as an expert to promote that info. Huzzah, I am a Twitter resident!\nI am no stranger to networks. I have heavily relied on different personal networks to advance my career and conduct research. However, I hadn’t really considered my digital network until this week. In a lot of ways I am a digital dead end. Information flows to me and stops unless I email or instant message a link directly to someone. I can see how engaging more on a platform like Twitter could be a way to expand my reach to students and funnel things I learn about to them. I could use this as a way to reach students outside of the classroom and beyond the one semester I may have with them. Looks like I have a lot of work to do on my digital network.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nMy two Twitters\nNext Post\nLearning, Networking, and Connecting\n(1) Comment\nJennifer Nissen\nJuly 8, 2018 at 8:34 pm\nReply\nAdam,  I feel like a digital dead end, too.  I totally relate to what you wrote, “Information flows to me and stops unless I email or instant message a link directly to someone.”  I send lots of info to others folks but always directly to them, not through a network.  I saw lots of examples on Twitter of folks amplifying the conversation.  Still lots to learn!\nLeave a Reply to\nJennifer Nissen\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nWebsite\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed\n.\nAuthor Login\nLogin\nAll Posts by Category\nAnnouncements\n(1)\nIdentity\n(36)\nImplementation Report\n(17)\nNetworks\n(22)\nPedagogy\n(17)\nScholarship\n(10)\nUncategorized\n(4)\nAll Posts by Month\nJune 2020\n(11)\nMay 2020\n(5)\nApril 2020\n(6)\nDecember 2019\n(2)\nJuly 2019\n(11)\nJune 2019\n(7)\nMay 2019\n(2)\nApril 2019\n(1)\nFebruary 2019\n(5)\nJanuary 2019\n(25)\nDecember 2018\n(1)\nAugust 2018\n(1)\nJuly 2018\n(16)\nJune 2018\n(12)\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 7 other subscribers\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\n%d\nbloggers like this:"}

Shan’s time limit and Katie’s pomodoro suggestions are highly appreciated. I’m definitely going to take them into account as I continue exploring week 2’s dig. networks. In addition, I also find the recommended videos/readings extremely useful. Alison Seaman’s article is particularly interesting because it addresses ICTs, PLEs and PKM, which I’m certain will assist me in developing a strong currency in PLNs. Some of the key ideas are when she describes how digital isolation is a product of technical skills and an understanding of the social elements online. When used efficiently, PLN entails digital responsibility for two main reasons: 1) to have a sense of self-direction to work as required to develop one’s own digital and web literacies; and 2) to improve mutual learning which is based on trusting reciprocity. That is, a self-assessment is required to learn and share within networks. As someone who advocates for diversity, I am pleased to learn that a PLN avoids becoming an “echo chamber” while promoting global digital diversification.\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\nPost Navigation\nPrev Post\nNetworking Process – How I use Twitter\nNext Post\nAn atmosphere of growth\n(2) Comments\nReid\nJuly 3, 2018 at 5:15 pm\nReply\nIt is valuable to have a window into your thinking.
